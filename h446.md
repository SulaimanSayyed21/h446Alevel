## Introduction: 1.0

### Overview of the 11 Plus Examination (1.1)

The 11 plus, or Eleven Plus, exam is a big deal for children in England and Northern Ireland when they're about 11 years old. It's like a ticket to selective secondary schools, such as grammar schools and some private ones.

#### Content of the Exam (1.2)

Depending on where you take it, the test covers `English, Maths, verbal reasoning, and non-verbal reasoning`. It's all about seeing how well one can solve problems and show better cognition abilities.

#### Who Takes It and Where? (Stakeholders) (1.3)

The number of children taking the 11-plus exams changes a lot depending on where you are in the UK. Some places still use it to decide who gets into certain schools, but others have different systems.

#### Why It’s a Big Deal (1.4)

People talk a lot about the 11-plus because it's seen as a big deal for children's futures. A better School means a better education one gets and more chances available to learn and compete with the elite class in the future where thousands of pounds fee is required.

#### The Reason to Select This Competitive Test Exam (1.5)


I have undertaken this examination, as has one of my sisters. Within our community, it enjoys considerable popularity, with numerous students competing for placements in esteemed grammar schools. Presently, freely accessible practice materials are scarce online. While various websites, such as [Bond 11 Plus](https://www.bond11plus.co.uk) offer packages for online practice via their digital platforms, they typically require purchase. However, some platforms, like [11 Plus Guide](https://www.11plusguide.com) permit the download of sample papers for manual practice. Additionally, I have [compiled a list](#compiled-list-of-11-websites) of other relevant online resources, along with several books and papers available in my personal collection. Notably, one of the frequently consulted books is published by NelSon-Thrones of Oxford University Press[^1](#references).

The diverse content covered in the aforementioned examination offers significant opportunities for an A-level project student to develop either a digital website or a mobile application platform. These platforms would enable 11+ students to engage in online practice sessions for the examinations at no cost. Given the extensive range of subjects covered, including English language, Mathematics, and reasoning, the project's scope is vast and cannot be fully addressed within its confines. As such, I have elected to focus solely on Verbal Reasoning for the purpose of this project

<div class="page"/>

## ANALYSIS 2.0

### Problem Identification (2.1)

The prevailing challenge in this area lies in the scarcity of accessible and comprehensive resources for students preparing for the 11+ Exams. While traditional textbooks exist, they often lack interactivity and cost-effectiveness in digital formats. Furthermore, existing platforms typically require students to purchase packages, limiting access based on financial constraints. 

> Note: There  exist  no platform where those who can contribute time and resources  to help  11+ students digitally as no such repository online is present.

### Introduction of Proposed Solution and Stakeholder Needs (2.2)

To address this issue, a proposed solution focuses on creating a digital platform specifically tailored for 11+ Verbal Reasoning practices. While other areas may be equally important, this project intentionally focuses solely on Verbal Reasoning to remain within the scope of an A-Level project. Here are the key features and benefits of this solution:

1. The platform will focus on Verbal Reasoning exercises for 11+ Exams. Students can improve critical thinking and language skills.
2. Unlike traditional textbooks, the digital solution lets students actively participate. They solve problems, get instant feedback, and track their progress. It’s a better learning experience!

3. Unlike static textbooks, the digital solution will provide an engaging experience. Students can actively participate and receive instant feedback, and track their progress including timed challenges, detailed explanations, and helpful hints, which will enhance the learning experience."

4. The commitment to accessibility means that all content will be available to students at no cost. By eliminating the need for expensive subscriptions or purchases, a wider audience can benefit from the platform.

5. Recognizing the prevalence of handheld devices, the platform will be designed for seamless use on mobile phones and tablets. Students can practice Verbal Reasoning questions anytime, anywhere, without desktop constraints. Additionally, the solution will be optimized for both online and offline modes, ensuring uninterrupted learning even in areas with limited internet connectivity.

6. Beyond content consumption, the platform will foster collaboration. Educators, programmers, and subject matter experts can contribute additional materials, share insights, and enhance the repository. For instance, psychology professionals could design exercises to improve memory and cognition, while educators with expertise in focus enhancement strategies could contribute valuable insights.

7. In addition to practice exercises, the platform will offer analytical solutions. Students can explore detailed explanations, learn problem-solving techniques, and gain deeper insights into the reasoning behind correct answers. This analytical approach encourages a holistic understanding of Verbal Reasoning concepts.

In summary, the proposed solution aims to bridge the gap by providing a free, interactive, and comprehensive digital platform exclusively focused on Verbal Reasoning practice for 11+ Exams. Leveraging technology, collaboration, and accessibility, this initiative seeks to empower students on their educational journey. 

> Note: This solution is not going to be a static website built by any Static Site Generators

[//]:# (After engaging in discussions with stakeholders, including students, parents, and educators, and reflecting on my personal experience of taking these exams, it has become evident that there is a significant demand for accessible, engaging, and effective resources for 11+ exam preparation. To support this assertion, I offer an example from my own family, wherein my parents sought to provide us with ample assistance. However, as previously mentioned, both my sister and I encountered challenges in accessing the necessary support, highlighting the existing gap in available resources.)

### Describing and Justifying Computational Approach (2.3)

1. Verbal Reasoning questions are inherently structured and can be systematically analysed by computational methods.
2. Computational methods allow for the creation of dynamic and interactive question formats, personalized practice sessions, and adaptive learning experiences tailored to individual student needs.
3. Additionally, computational approaches enable the scalability and accessibility of the solution, making it available to a wide audience regardless of geographical location or socioeconomic status.
4. By leveraging computational methods, we can automate the generation of practice questions, provide instant feedback to students, and track their progress over time, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of exam preparation.
5. By integrating computational methods into the solution, we can harness the power of technology to address the challenges of 11+ exam preparation, making it more engaging, accessible, and personalized for students.

### Identifying and Justifying Specific Features (2.4)

1. Comprehensive coverage of Verbal Reasoning topics.
2. Designing interactive question formats dynamically using JavaScript in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
3. These question formats can include  `multiple-choice, matching, fill-in-the-blank, underlining, choosing words from groups and pairs`.
4. More complex question formats can be designed for example presenting users with more than two categories and asking them to select a number of words belonging to a specific category.

### How to Implement the Proposed Solution (2.5)

1. The front end of the app will utilize technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to handle the user interface (UI). For server support, Node.js and its extensive libraries will be employed on the back end. Project structure and module installation will be managed using NPM.
2. A templating engine will simplify HTML code creation, while JavaScript will manage computational logic such as verifying selected answers. JavaScript can also read content from JSON files containing practice and mock data.
3. To streamline Node.js development, the `express` module will be utilized, though alternative frameworks like `React Angular` are viable options.
4. When creating test or exercise content, two approaches are feasible: dynamically generating content with JavaScript or designing the user interface with placeholders filled by JavaScript logic.
5. Sound files may enhance user interaction by signalling success or failure.
6. Data will be stored in JSON format, commonly used with JavaScript libraries.
7. The solution will be device-agnostic, prioritizing compatibility with all devices rather than specific mobile app technologies like Swift or Java.
8. Utilizing Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) will offer a mobile app-like experience, accessible through web browsers with features like offline support, push notifications, and home screen installation.
9. The digital solution will be developed in a Git repository, facilitating collaboration and improvement through platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
10. Cloud servers will host the solution to ensure scalability and accessibility from any internet-connected device.
11. MongoDB, a non-SQL database, will store user credentials. MongoDB Atlas services will be utilized to create an online database for this purpose.
12. Responsive design using Bootstrap will guarantee compatibility across various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
13. User-friendly interfaces and optimized performance will be prioritized to deliver a seamless user experience across different hardware and software configurations.

### Limitations of the Proposed Solution (2.6)

1. While much has been proposed as a potential solution, several challenges lie ahead, particularly in tailoring the website or app for personalized use. This entails the incorporation of distinct logic for each individual user and the secure storage of their credentials within the database.
2. Though There exist many open-source platform, like `GitLab, GitHub( no longer an open source ) and  Bitbucket` that offers features for managing code repositories yet publishing the repository on clouds to make it available online requires funding.
3. Some platform offers a small chuck of their cloud space to be used and here it is hoped that such an application can enter and find a place.

> Note: I plan to commence the project with a focus on simplicity to meet the requirements outlined in H446 OCR A Level Computer Science (NEA: Non-exam assessment). This approach will allow for a gradual progression, ensuring that the project remains manageable and aligned with the specified criteria.

### Justifying Hardware and Software Choices (2.7)

**What technologies are needed for a developer**:

The hardware technologies required  to create websites or PWAs do not necessitate specialized hardware, unlike certain machine learning applications that demand specific computational power. Instead, a standard desktop or laptop with operating systems such as Windows 10/11, Ubuntu (Linux distribution), or macOS on Apple machines will suffice. As for software selection, following tools tools will be used mainly.

1. [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write the code.
2. [Microsoft Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?rtc=1&hl=en-gb&gl=GB) to interact with git.
3. [PickPick](https://picpick.app/) to get the snapshot of the website.
4. [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to display the result.
5. [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) to provide server side handling.
6. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to keep track the record of the repository.
7. [GitHub](https://github.com/) to upload the repository on the clouds and free hosing.
8. [Mongoose Database]([https://](https://www.mongodb.com/)) to store user credentials safely.

### Identifying and Justifying Success Criteria for the Proposed Solution (2.8)

1. The success of the proposed website can be measured through various quantifiable criteria that directly reflect its effectiveness in addressing the identified problem and meeting stakeholder needs.
2. Firstly, the website's user engagement metrics, such as the number of active users, session duration, and frequency of visits, can serve as indicators of its popularity and usefulness among students, parents, and other users.
3. Secondly, the completion rates of practice sessions and quizzes within the website will gauge the extent to which users are actively utilizing its resources for exam preparation.
4. Thirdly, user satisfaction surveys and feedback mechanisms can provide valuable insights into the perceived value, usability, and overall satisfaction with the website's features and functionality.
5. By establishing these measurable success criteria, we can objectively evaluate the impact and effectiveness of the website in supporting 11+ exam preparation and achieving its intended goals.

<div class="page"/>

### Requirements for Such a Project (2.9)

1. Websites typically follow a client-server architecture, where the client refers to the user's web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari), and the server refers to a remote computer that hosts the website's files and data. When a user visits a website, their browser sends a request to the server, asking for the website's content. These request uses HTTP verbs such as `GET` method for the page navigation.
2. Similarly when a user submits a form on a webpage (such as a login form, registration form, or search form), the browser sends a request to the server to process the form data. This request can use either the HTTP GET or POST method, depending on the form's configuration and the type of data being submitted.
3. Web pages often contain resources such as images, style sheets, scripts, and fonts that are loaded asynchronously from the server. Each of these resources triggers a separate request to the server, allowing the browser to fetch and render them independently while the rest of the page loads.
4. Modern web applications frequently interact with remote APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to retrieve data, perform actions, or integrate with external services. These API requests can be initiated from the client side using various techniques, such as AJAX, the fetch API, or client-side libraries/frameworks.
5. All the above usually refers to a term commonly known as `Client/Server` architecture.  
6. **Client-Side Activities**: Client-side activities refer to tasks and operations that are performed within the user's web browser. This includes rendering HTML, executing JavaScript code, and handling user interactions such as clicks and form submissions. Client-side activities are responsible for creating the user interface and providing interactivity to the user.
7. **Server-Side Activities**: Server-side activities, on the other hand, are performed on the server, typically using server-side technologies like Node.js. These activities include processing user requests, executing business logic, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content. Server-side activities are responsible for handling the Backend operations of the application, such as user authentication, data validation, and database management.
8. **Role of Node.js in Client-Server Communication**:Node.js plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between the client-side and server-side components of web applications. It serves as the backend infrastructure for handling client requests, processing data, and sending responses back to the client. By leveraging the power of Node.js, developers can build fast, scalable, and real-time web applications that deliver a seamless user experience across different devices and platforms.

<div class="page"/>

#### Why Node.js? (2.9.1)

1. **JavaScript Everywhere**: With Node.js, developers can use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, enabling a consistent and unified codebase.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Node.js utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which allows for efficient handling of concurrent requests and real-time applications.
3. **Vibrant Ecosystem**: Node.js has a large and active community, providing a wealth of libraries and tools to streamline development.
4. **Scalability**: Node.js applications can easily scale to handle large numbers of concurrent connections, making it suitable for building robust and scalable web applications.

#### How a Simple Node.js Server Is Created? (2.9.2)

The following code creates  a simple Node.js server that is run locally for developing environment.

```js
// Import the 'http' module
const http = require('http');
// Define the hostname and port number
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;
// Create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Set the response status and headers
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  // Send the response
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});
// Start the server and listen for incoming requests
server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

```

The above code does the followings:

1. Require the built-in http module, which provides functionality for creating HTTP servers using `const http = require('http');`. Declaring some variables for the port and hostname and assigned them some values.
2. Uses the `http.createServer()` method to create a server instance. Pass a callback function to handle incoming requests.
3. Within the callback function, handle incoming HTTP requests. This involves reading request data, processing it, and sending back a response.
4. Specify the port number on which the server should listen for incoming requests.

Similarly the same can be done using a nodejs module called `express` since it provides number of functionalities to ease the job it is also known as express framework. Following code shows how the same job is done using express module.

```js
// Import the Express framework
const express = require('express');
// Create an Express application
const app = express();
// Define a route handler for the root path
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Send a response
  res.send('Hello, World!\n');
});
// Define the port number
const port = 3000;
// Start the server and listen for incoming requests
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

If we see the above code closely there is not much difference except that express module is used and GET request is handled by a route. This is not we intend to achieve from express but we want our code to be modular and properly structured. For this purpose we use an MVC ( modal view controller ) architecture where components of a websites are treated separately.

#### MVC (Model-View-Controller) Architecture (2.9.3)

1. it is a design pattern commonly used in software development to organize code and separate concerns.
2. **Model**: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the application's data and defines how it can be manipulated.In a database-driven web application, models often interact with the database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.View.
3. **View**: The view is responsible for presenting the user interface and displaying data to the user. It renders the model's data in a format suitable for presentation, such as HTML, XML, or JSON. Views are typically passive components that receive data from the controller and display it to the user.
4. **Controller**: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It handles user input and updates the model accordingly. Controllers contain the application's business logic, process user requests, and determine which view to render in response.

- Following is a basic flow of an Express application

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Client-->ExpressApp;
    ExpressApp-->View;
    ExpressApp-->RouteRequest;
    RouteRequest-->HandleRequest;
    HandleRequest-->RetrieveData;
    RetrieveData-->RenderHTML;
    RenderHTML-->SendHTTPResponse;
    SendHTTPResponse-->Client;
```

#### Key Principles (2.9.4)

1. Separation of Concerns: MVC separates the application logic into distinct components, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
2. Modularity: Each component (model, view, controller) can be developed, tested, and modified independently, promoting code reusability and scalability.
3. Flexibility: MVC allows for flexible interaction between components, enabling developers to change one component without affecting others.
4. Scalability: The modular structure of MVC facilitates the development of large-scale applications by dividing them into manageable parts.

Overall, MVC architecture provides a robust foundation for building complex software systems by promoting separation of concerns, modularity, and flexibility. It remains a popular choice for developing web applications due to its clear structure and well-defined responsibilities for each component. For this reason I have decided to use this pattern and develop this project.

## Project Design and Implementation Overview (3.0)

The project's design and implementation entail developing a fully functional website as a digital platform hosted on a cloud server. This comprehensive process is divided into multiple stages, each comprising various sub-steps for thorough execution and management.

### Design  And Implementation Stages (3.1)

1. **Local Machine Setup:**
    This involves choosing the appropriate physical machine and operating system installed and configured with software tools to be used.

2. **Local And Remote Repository Setup:**
   This initial phase involves setting up a local repository to facilitate development and version control. The local repository serves as the primary workspace for designing and refining the project's components before deployment to the online server.

3. **Project Application Setup:**
   Once it is done project is started and when finished it is to be deployed.

4. **Website Development:**
   In this phase, the website's frontend and backend components are developed, encompassing UI/UX design, database integration, and application logic implementation. The development process adheres to industry best practices and standards to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience.

5. **Cloud Server Configuration:**
   The subsequent step focuses on configuring the cloud server infrastructure to host the website. This includes selecting an appropriate cloud service provider, provisioning server resources, and configuring server settings to ensure optimal performance and scalability.

6. **Deployment and Testing:**
   The final part involves deploying the developed website to the cloud server and conducting rigorous testing to validate its functionality, performance, and security. Deployment strategies are employed to ensure smooth transition from the local environment to the production server, followed by comprehensive testing procedures to identify and address any issues or vulnerabilities.

      2. *Step-2*:

#### Analysis of  Design Part A:  (3.2.1)

Part-A of the project encompasses four distinct stages, each comprising essential tasks aimed at developing and refining the user interface and database integration. These stages are referred to as **steps**, starting with Step-1, Step-2 and Step-3 etc., exhibiting overlapping functionalities:

1. **Step-1: GUI  Development of Home Page** 
   This initial stage focuses on crafting the graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring intuitive layout and user-friendly navigation. Design considerations include visual elements, layout structure, and interactive components to optimize user experience.

2. **Step-2: Database Setup**
   The second step involves configuring and establishing the database for the project. Database setup encompasses tasks such as defining database schema, creating collections ( Non SQL database ), and configuring data storage mechanisms, ensuring seamless integration with the application.

3. **Step-3: Interactive UI Elements**
   In Step-3, the focus shifts to enhancing user interaction by integrating UI elements with the database. This stage involves implementing functionalities that enable dynamic data retrieval, manipulation, and presentation. UI elements are programmed to interact with the underlying database, facilitating real-time data updates and (user feedback).

4. **Step-4:Page-Database Interaction Testing:**
   The final stage involves rigorous testing to validate the interaction between different pages/modules and the database. Testing scenarios encompass data retrieval, insertion, updating, and operations, ensuring consistency and accuracy in data handling. Comprehensive testing protocols are employed to identify and rectify any anomalies or discrepancies in page-database interactions.

#### Analysis of Design Part B (3.2.2)

Designing various user interface (UI) pages involves creating intuitive layouts and functionalities for different aspects of the application:
   

1. **Step-1: GUI Development of Dashboard and Practice Page**
   The dashboard serves as the central hub for users upon successful login. Here, users are presented with options to engage in practice activities or initiate a test session, providing them with seamless navigation to different sections of the application. Emphasis is placed on designing and refining the graphical user interface (GUI) for the practice page, ensuring intuitive layout and seamless navigation.

2. **Step-2: Injecting Contents dynamically**
   This involves implementing dynamic content injection mechanisms, enabling the practice page to dynamically populate the UI place-holders with relevant topics, lessons, and questions based on user interactions. Within the practice page, users are offered a selection of topics to choose from. Each topic comprises multiple lessons, typically ranging from 1 to 4. These lessons are structured to contain sets of questions and answers, with data stored locally in JSON format. Each lesson consists of 10 questions, providing users with ample practice opportunities.

3. **Step-3: Testing Interaction**
   This involves rigorous testing protocols are employed to validate the interaction between the practice page and underlying functionalities, ensuring seamless user experience and robust functionality.


#### Analysis of Design Part C (3.2.3)

1. **Step-1: UI Elements for Test Page**
   During Step-1, meticulous attention is given to designing and implementing the user interface (UI) elements for the test page, ensuring an intuitive layout and interactive features conducive to effective test-taking.

2. **Step-2: Designing Algorithm to Populate Test Page Contents**
   In Step-2, the focus shifts to designing and implementing algorithms responsible for dynamically populating the test page with relevant content, including randomized questions, ensuring variability and adaptability in each test session.

3. **Step-3: Conducting the Test with Time Limitations**
   Step-3 involves implementing time limitations for test sessions, simulating real-world examination conditions and fostering time management skills among users, thereby enhancing the authenticity and efficacy of the testing process.

4. **Step-4: Submitting the Test to the Server**
   During Step-4, mechanisms are devised and implemented to enable users to submit their completed tests to the server seamlessly, facilitating efficient data transmission and processing for subsequent analysis and evaluation.

5. **Step-5: Testing the Whole Process**
   Step-5 entails comprehensive testing of the entire test-taking process, from UI functionality to content generation and submission mechanisms, ensuring robustness, reliability, and optimal performance across diverse user scenarios.

-->  Implementing The Design Part-A  (4.0)

- As discussed above in section (2.9.3), we are to use the MVC architecture of express node module. In MVC architecture `views` represents the interface or the webpages that user can interact with. When users presses or clicks on these interfaces client initiates the request to navigate to a different page, this requests is handled by the MVC architecture using `routes`. Similarly what is to be done in response to the request can be handled by the `controller` components.
- Express frame work makes our job easy to keep all these components of the web developing environment by providing us separate folders to keep the work modular while working behind the scene providing the logic to interact with each other.

## Starting Project Application Setup (4.0)

1. Windows 10/11 machines are used equipped with dual processors running 16 threads with a raid setup. VSCode has been set up with the required extensions activated. Extensions used are shown in [Appendix-A](#appendix-a).

    ![local-machine.png](images\\docs\\local-machine.jpg)

2. VSCode has been set up with the required extensions activated. Extensions used are shown in [Appendix-A](#appendix-a).
3. Node.js, npm, and Git have been installed.
  
    ![version.png](images\\docs\\version.jpg)

4. GitHub has been chosen as the platform for uploading work, with an account under the username '`SulaimanSayyed21` already created.
5. An empty online remote repository with the same name has been created to connect with the local machine.
6. The next step involves configuring the Express framework.

### Setting Up the Express Node.js Framework (4.1)

Although the folder structure can be manually created, the express framework offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to streamline this process.
The express CLI is installed globally using the following npm command: `npm install -g express-generator`.
Express enables the utilization of various templating engines for HTML rendering purposes. In this context, the `ejs` templating engine has been selected for its compatibility and features.

#### Generating the Application Skeleton (4.1.2)

1. The command `express --view=ejs h446` creates a skeleton folder structure. The out put is shown below.

```
> express --view=ejs h446

   create : h446\
   create : h446\public\
   create : h446\public\javascripts\
   create : h446\public\images\
   create : h446\public\stylesheets\
   create : h446\public\stylesheets\style.css
   create : h446\routes\
   create : h446\routes\index.js
   create : h446\routes\users.js
   create : h446\views\
   create : h446\views\error.ejs
   create : h446\views\index.ejs
   create : h446\app.js
   create : h446\package.json
   create : h446\bin\
   create : h446\bin\www

   change directory:
     > cd h446
   install dependencies:
     > npm install
   run the app:
     > SET DEBUG=h446:* & npm start

```

Following is the listing of this directory.

```bash
Directory: K:\projects\2024\express\h446
Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
d----        08/04/2024     12:53                  bin
d----        08/04/2024     12:53                  public
d----        08/04/2024     12:53                  routes
d----        08/04/2024     12:53                  views
-a---        08/04/2024     12:53           1074   app.js
-a---        08/04/2024     12:53            290   package.json
```

- The application project folder name is provided above as `h446`. The above command also sets the html templating engine to be `ejs`.


#### Initializing Git and Linking It to the GitHub Repo (4.1.3)

1. **Initializing Git in the Project Folder:** 

   The `git` version control system was initialized within the `h446` folder using the following command:

   ```bash
   > git init
   ```

2. **Adding Contents to the Staging Area:** Following initialization, the contents of the project folder were added to the staging area using the command:
  
   ```bash
   > git aa
   ```

3. **Committing Changes with Comments:** Upon staging the changes, a commit was made with descriptive comments to track the progress of the project: is made giving some comments.
  
   ```bash
   > git cm "initial commit: express app generated using express cli, setting templating engine as ejs"
   ```

In above commands, `git aa` and `git cm` are aliases set up for Git commands to streamline the workflow. These aliases offer shortcuts for commonly used Git commands, enhancing efficiency in project management. Aliases were defined for Git commands by modifying the Git configuration file, they are shown in [Appendix-B](#appendix-b).

Taking a git log shows the out put of repo state.

```bash
> git log
commit 50e4c936f0a8cb1783dd76e199da7e1ac346f487 (HEAD -> main)
Author: SulaimanSayyed21 <sullisayyed21@outlook.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 8 12:59:25 2024 +0100
```

#### Establishing Connection with Remote Repository (4.1.4)

To establish a connection between the local repository and its remote counterpart on GitHub, the following steps were executed:

1. **Adding Remote Repository:**

The local repository was linked to the remote repository hosted on GitHub using the command:

```bash
> git remote add origin https://github.com/SulaimanSayyed21/h446Alevel.git
```

This command specifies the URL of the remote repository (https://github.com/SulaimanSayyed21/h446Alevel.git) and assigns it the name origin.

2. **Setting Branch Name:** To set the branch name to main, the following command was executed:
  
```bash
 > git branch -M main
```

3. **Pushing Changes to Remote:** Finally, the local repository was pushed to the remote repository on GitHub using the command:
  
```bash
 > git push -u origin main
```

This command uploads local commits to the remote repository, establishing synchronization between the two. Upon executing the push command, the output confirming the successful transmission of changes to the remote repository is displayed in the terminal.

```bash
 > git push -u origin main
Enumerating objects: 15, done.
Counting objects: 100% (15/15), done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

Having pushed the local repo to the remote, following is the snapshot of the remote repo.

![github-01.jpg](images\\docs\\github-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-2*

- Express framework has created a `project.json` file which contents are shown below.

```json
{
  "name": "h446",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node ./bin/www"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
    "debug": "~2.6.9",
    "ejs": "~2.6.1",
    "express": "~4.16.1",
    "http-errors": "~1.6.3",
    "morgan": "~1.9.1"
  }
}
```

#### Setting Up Application Dependencies and Running the Script (4.1.5)

The preceding steps have configured the application's name and associated details. Additionally, a script has been provided to execute the application. Within the dependencies folder, it indicates the libraries upon which this project relies. However, these dependencies have not been installed yet. The initial step involves installing them using the command `npm install`. Upon executing this command, `npm` installs all the required libraries, placing them within the `node_modules` folder. Subsequently, it becomes essential to verify the functionality of our application skeleton. By employing the command `npm run start`, the script is initiated, running the application on port 3000. Below is the terminal output for reference:

```txt
> npm run start
> h446@0.0.0 start
> node ./bin/www

GET / 200 88.382 ms - 207
GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 5.964 ms - 111
GET /sw.js 404 3.356 ms - 993
GET / 200 2.621 ms - 207
GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 2.111 ms - 111
GET /favicon.ico 404 2.472 ms - 993
```

- The above information shows us that server is run from `./bin/www` directory and different `GET` requests are made, the last one status shows `404` means that there was no `favicon` found. As the project goes along details will be provided of what is happening. The server running on port 3000 snapshot is shown below.

![localhost-01.jpg](images\\docs\\localhost-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-3*

#### Implementing Nodemon for Automatic Server Updates (4.1.6)

To streamline our development process, the `npm` library `nodemon` is incorporated. This library facilitates automatic server updates while we work on our project. By continuously monitoring any changes in the codebase, `nodemon` promptly updates the server upon saving files, eliminating the need for manual server restarts. The installation of `nodemon` is achieved via the command `npm i nodemon`. It is noteworthy that `nodemon` can be installed either globally or locally within the project. In this instance, a global installation is opted for, providing versatility across various projects. Subsequently, a script is added to the `project.json` file, specifying the line of code: `"dev":"nodemon --ext js,ejs,json,css ./bin/www"`. This script, labelled as `dev`, signifies our development environment. The command `npm run dev` initiates this script, wherein `nodemon` is instructed to monitor changes in files with extensions: `.js`, `.ejs`, `.json`, and `.css`. Upon executing `npm run dev` to start the server, the following output is observed:


```txt
> npm run dev
> h446@0.0.0 dev
> nodemon --ext js,ejs,json,css ./bin/www

[nodemon] 3.1.0
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: js,ejs,json,css
[nodemon] starting `node ./bin/www`
```

- Since we have added the `node_modules` and it is a git project we create a `.gitignore` file so that `node_modules` folder is not included in our project. It is a common practice as it includes thousand of libraries folders. When anyone else clone this repository, one has to only run `npm install` and all dependencies are installed and project is run. Also adding `Readme.md` file. Readme.md is a markdown file which can be rendered on any browser, it frees us to write contents in html file using different elements as `<h1>` etc. A commit is made to save the state of the repository.

> Note: So far we have created a `Node.js` express skeleton app that gives us a server which is running on the local machine on the port 3000. No code for the required app is written.

### Analysing the express skeleton structure (4.2)


Before delving into the development process, it's imperative to comprehend the structure and functioning of the Express server. This entails identifying the designated locations for webpages, stylesheets, JavaScript code, and other static files such as images. Subsequently, the development entails writing the logic or code for our application. This involves determining the appropriate folder structure and implementing the necessary logic for Express to interpret and execute our intended functionalities effectively.To gain insight into the folder structure generated by Express, the `tree /F` command is utilized in the terminal. The resulting structure is depicted below:

```txt
K:.
│   app.js
│   package.json
│
├───bin
│       www
│
├───public
│   ├───images
│   ├───javascripts
│   └───stylesheets
│           style.css
│
├───routes
│       index.js
│       users.js
│
└───views
        error.ejs
        index.ejs
```

#### Analysis of Express Project Structure (4.2.1)

The examination of the project structure reveals crucial insights into the organization and functionality of various components:

1. **Main Application File (`app.js`):**
   Positioned at the root of the project, `app.js` serves as the primary application file, orchestrating the execution flow and integrating various modules.

2. **Public Folder:**
   The public folder serves as a repository for static files that remain unchanged during runtime. These files, such as stylesheets and client-side scripts, contribute to the user interface's presentation and behaviour.

3. **Views Directory:**
   Within the views directory, HTML pages are authored and stored. This directory constitutes the frontend aspect of the client/server architecture, housing the visual elements presented to users.

4. **Routes Directory:**
   The routes directory houses the routing logic responsible for directing navigation within the application. It represents the backend functionality of the client/server architecture, handling requests and generating appropriate responses.

5. **Bin Directory and `www` Script:**
   The bin directory accommodates the `www` file, a JavaScript script devoid of extensions. Despite its unassuming name, `www` holds significant importance as it is responsible for creating the server instance. This script, generated by the Express server, facilitates server management tasks such as execution, debugging, and error handling.

Below is an excerpt from the `www` script:

> Note: It was possible to delete all the contents provided by the express framework and starts writing the logic from the beginning but it would have been useless as express only provides the basic logic which we would have to write again. To delete and write the same code is not a good practice in software engineering and referred as reinventing the wheel.


```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

var app = require('../app');
var debug = require('debug')('h446:server');
var http = require('http');

var port = normalizePort(process.env.PORT || '3000');
app.set('port', port);

var server = http.createServer(app);

server.listen(port);
server.on('error', onError);
server.on('listening', onListening);

function normalizePort(val) {
  var port = parseInt(val, 10);
  if (isNaN(port)) {
    // named pipe
    return val;
  }
  if (port >= 0) {
    // port number
    return port;
  }
  return false;
}

function onError(error) {
  if (error.syscall !== 'listen') {
    throw error;
  }
  var bind = typeof port === 'string'
    ? 'Pipe ' + port
    : 'Port ' + port;
  // handle specific listen errors with friendly messages
  switch (error.code) {
    case 'EACCES':
      console.error(bind + ' requires elevated privileges');
      process.exit(1);
      break;
    case 'EADDRINUSE':
      console.error(bind + ' is already in use');
      process.exit(1);
      break;
    default:
      throw error;
  }
}

function onListening() {
  var addr = server.address();
  var bind = typeof addr === 'string'
    ? 'pipe ' + addr
    : 'port ' + addr.port;
  debug('Listening on ' + bind);
}
```

#### Examining www Script (4.2.2)

1. **Shebang**: `#!/usr/bin/env node` - This line specifies that the script should be executed by the Node.js runtime. The symbol `#!` is shell environment is known as `Shebang` and must be the first part of the first line of the script for the script to run successfully.
2. **Module Dependencies**: The script requires necessary modules:
    - `var app = require('../app');`: This imports the `app.js` from the root folder.
    - `var debug = require('debug')('h446:server')`: This is used for debugging purpose providing the name for our root folder.
    - `var http = require('http');`: To use the http object for the server to start it gets the handle to the node built in `http` module.

3. **Get Port**: The script attempts to obtain the port number from the environment variables. If not found, it defaults to port 3000. This port number is then set on the Express application.

4. **Create HTTP Server**: The script creates an HTTP server using the `http.createServer()` method and passes the Express application (`app`) to it.

5. **Event Listeners**:
    - `server.on('error', onError)`: Listens for any errors that occur when starting the server.
    - `server.on('listening', onListening)`: Listens for when the server starts listening for connections.

6. **Normalize Port Function**: This function attempts to normalize the provided port into a number, string, or false by using if logic and checking different possible situations.

7. **Error Handling**: The `onError` function handles errors that occur when starting the server, such as permission issues or port conflicts. It also provides the logic by having a `switch` statement and displays the code using `console.error` function.

8. **Listening Event Handling**: The `onListening` function logs a message indicating that the server is listening on a specific port or pipe.

> Note: in short express has provided much more sophisticated logic to handle the errors and encountering possible mistakes. The same task was earlier provided by simple logic as shown above under the heading "How a simple nodejs server is created".

#### Examining app.js Code (4.2.3)

- It is the main entry point for an Express application. It is where the application is configured, routes are defined, middleware is applied, and the server is started. Lets examine this code.

```js
// app.js 

var createError = require('http-errors');
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var logger = require('morgan');

var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var usersRouter = require('./routes/users');

var app = express();

// view engine setup
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

app.use(logger('dev'));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(cookieParser());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

app.use('/', indexRouter);
app.use('/users', usersRouter);

// catch 404 and forward to error handler
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  next(createError(404));
});

// error handler
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // set locals, only providing error in development
  res.locals.message = err.message;
  res.locals.error = req.app.get('env') === 'development' ? err : {};

  // render the error page
  res.status(err.status || 500);
  res.render('error');
});

module.exports = app;
```

1. The code begins by requiring necessary modules such as `http-errors, express, path, cookie-parser, and logger`. These modules are used for handling errors, creating the Express application, working with file paths, parsing cookies, and logging requests. This is how the node application works using CommonJs model syntax. In contrast to CommonJs ES6 uses `import/export` syntax to achieve the same goal.
2. Next, it requires route files for handling different parts of the application. indexRouter and usersRouter are required from their respective route files `(./routes/index)` and `(./routes/users)`. The index routes represents our home page and can be accessed using `http:<URL>/` or `http:<url>index`, as we are using localhost on port 3000, we will get our home page using `localhost:3000` respectively.
3. An instance of Express application is created and stored in the variable `app` using `var app = express()`.
4. Express is configured to use the EJS view engine. The views directory is set to `views`, and the view engine is set to `ejs`.
5. Middleware functions are applied to the Express application using the `app.use()` method. in short wherever express uses `app.use()` this format is used to setup the middleware. All the above defined middleware `use` methods are handled by the express internally these include:
    - `logger('dev')`: Configures logging middleware with the 'dev' format..
    - `app.use(express.json()) and app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))`: Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded request bodies.
    - `cookieParser()`: Parsing cookies attached to incoming requests.
    - `express.static()`: Serving static files from the 'public' directory.

6. `app.use('/', indexRouter)`: Mounts the index router at the root URL `('/')`. This route is to be handled by us or the developer to provide the logic what happens when the home page is served.
Similarly `app.use('/users', usersRouter)`: Mounts the users router at the '/users' URL. While `app.use(function(req, res, next) { ... })`: Handles 404 errors by passing them to the next middleware. 

> Note: The function arguments `req` means the request and `res` means the response sent when receiving the request while `nex` represent what is to be done next, in above case it invokes the `createError(404)`method.

1. `app.use(function(err, req, res, next) { ... })`: It is a central error-handling middleware which sets the error status, renders an error page, and sends an error response.

2. `module.exports = app`: Exports the Express application to make it available to other modules.

Overall, app.js sets up an Express application, configures middleware, defines routes, and handles errors to create a robust web server.

#### Examining Views Folder  (4.2.4)

1. As mentioned earlier it is this folder which represents the front end of our website. Express provides us with two files. One is `error.js` which contains nothing but three lines logic to show the error messages and express uses this file to show an error if encounters. The code is shown below.
2. Since we are using ejs templating engine its notation `<% %> or <%- %> or <%= %>` is used in above code. We will leave this file as it is.

```ejs
<h1><%= message %></h1>
<h2><%= error.status %></h2>
<pre><%= error.stack %></pre>
```

The second file is `index.ejs` which serves as our home page. Earlier when we ran our server the website snap shot shown above gives us the message defined in this page. Following is the code for this file. We do not intend to use this file and its contents will be deleted.

```html
// index.ejs 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title><%= title %></title>
    <link rel='stylesheet' href='/stylesheets/style.css' />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><%= title %></h1>
    <p>Welcome to <%= title %></p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Before we start to work we will also see what is present in our `route` folder.

#### Examining Route Folder (4.2.5)

The route folder has two files containing the code of handling the navigation of home page and the users. We first look at the `index.js` or home page routing code.

```js
// index.js 

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Express' });
});
module.exports = router;
```

1. The code begins by importing the express module and creating a new router instance using express.Router().
2. ext a route is defined using the get() method of the router object. This route handles `HTTP GET` requests to the root path ('/').
3. The route callback function takes three parameters req (request), res (response), and next.
4. Inside the route handler function, the `res.render()` method is used to render the index view template with some data. In this case, it sets the `title` variable to `Express`.
5. Finally, the router object is exported using `module.exports`, making it available for use in other parts of the application.

In short this route serves as the handler for the home page ('/') of the Express application, rendering the index view template and passing it the title 'Express'. Having done with the route folder it takes us to the one more file provided by the express framework in `public/stylesheet/styles.css`. It is used to provide some styles, we are not going to use this file and contents of this file will be deleted.

```css
// styles.css
body {
  padding: 50px;
  font: 14px "Lucida Grande", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
a {
  color: #00B7FF;
}
```

- Express does not provide any script so the javascript folder is empty.

> Note: So far we have examined the express skeleton structure and the code provided. The next step is to provide the logic for our intended website.

Before going any further vscode snapshot is taken to show how work is done in it.

<div class="page"/>

## Implementing Design Part-A Step-1: Creating Home Page (4.3)

The website shows an interface to the user to interact with so that one can login or register. Here a GUI for this purpose is designed.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    HomePage-->LoginPage;
    HomePage-->SignupPage;
    LoginPage-->HomePage;
    SignupPage-->HomePage;
```

These three pages initial sketch is designed and  shown in the following diagram.

![app-design-01](images\\docs\\app-design-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-1*


```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User visits website] -->|GET| B{Login or Signup}
    B -->|Signup| C[Client-side email criteria checked]-->C
    C -->|Validate email format| D[Submit form]
    D -->|POST| E[Redirect to Login page, HTTP GET]
    D -->|Validation failure| B
    B -->|Login| F[Client-side password confirm criteria checked]-->F
    F -->|Validate password criteria| G[Submit form]
    G -->|POST| H[Redirect to dashboard, HTTP GET]
    G -->|Failure| B
```

The application should adhere to the layout outlined in Part-A, comprising three distinct pages: the homepage, login page, and Signup page. Each page should seamlessly link to the others, ensuring smooth navigation between them.


### Creating a Home Page (4.3.1)

Starting from the home page: the contents of `index.ejs` are removed. A new folder named `layout` is created in views folder and `header.ejs` template is created. The contents of the this file is shown below.

```html
// index.js 

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title><%= title %></title>
  </title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico">
  <!-- Link to local Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/bootstrap-5.0.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <!-- Link to Custom CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/styles.css">
  <!-- bootstrap icons cdn link -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css">
</head>
```

- The reason to create the head layout is that this app has three different pages so far and they all have to have the above code in those files. By creating the template we ony need to insert the template reference and they will be rendered.

### Analysing the Code  (4.3.2)

- `<!doctype html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML being used.
- `<html lang="en">`: Defines the root element of the HTML document and specifies the language of the content (English).
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the title, character encoding, viewport settings, and links to external resources.
  - `<title><%= title %></title>`: Sets the title of the HTML document dynamically using EJS syntax. The value of the `title` variable will be inserted here.
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Defines the character encoding of the document as UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters.
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`: Configures the viewport settings for responsive web design. It sets the width of the viewport to the width of the device and sets the initial zoom level to 1.
  - `<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico">`: Specifies the favicon (shortcut icon) for the website.
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/bootstrap-5.0.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">`: Links to the local Bootstrap CSS file, which provides styling for the HTML elements using Bootstrap.
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/styles.css">`: Links to a custom CSS file (`styles.css`) for additional styling specific to the application.
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css">`: Links to the Bootstrap Icons CDN (Content Delivery Network) for using icons in the application.

The above sets up the basic structure and styling for an HTML document in this application, ensuring proper rendering and styling of the content. In above code bootstrap files are accessed locally thus  they are to be  downloaded in `public` folder. As mentioned earlier express framework looks for static files in the public directory. Custom styles and scripts are to be placed under this folder. Following folders are created under public folder and related files are downloaded from the [Bootstrap site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/download/). Vscode snapshot shows these folder and files.

![bootstrap.jpg](images\docs\\bootstrap.jpg)<br>
*figure-5*

The contests of the  `style.css` provided by express are deleted. An `icons` folder is also created to keep the application related icons.

- Following is a snap shot of remote github showing the current changes.

*figure-6*

### Creating Homepage Header Layout (4.3.3)

> Note: header.ejs name is changed to head.ejs as head and header represent different sections of html page .

- All pages of our application shares the header and footer, though footer is same but header differs. The home page offers user to login or to Signup option we first write this template.
- The home page would contain this format.

```txt
head template
header template
main section of the home page
footer template
```

- Creating `loginheader.ejs` template in `layout` folder under `views`. Following are the contents of `loginheader.ejs` template.

```html
// loginheader.ejs 
<body>
    <header>
      <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
              <h3>
                Verbal Reasoning
              </h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-auto">
              <a href="/login" class="anchor"> Login</a>
              <a href="/signup" class="anchor"> Signup</a>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
    </header>
```

- Similarly `footer.ejs` template is also created under the same folder. The contents are shown below.
  
```html
// footer.ejs
<footer>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h3>A Level Project by Sulaiman Sayyed</h3>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</footer>
</body>
```

- Now we need to add these layout templates into our home page which is `index.ejs` file which is also an ejs template. The contents are shown below.

```html
//index.js

<%- include('layout/head.ejs'); %>
  <%- include('layout/loginheader.ejs'); %>
    <main>
    </main>
    <%- include('layout/footer.ejs'); %>
      <script src="bootstrap-5.0.2/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
      </body>

      </html>
```

- Running our server using `npm run dev` and it is started on port 3000.
- When the port is open in chrome, it shows the following error on the webpage.

![error-01.jpg](images\\docs\\error-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-7*

- It is to be noted that what happens when the page is not found a `404` page is shown, since express provides the logic to show the error output handling in www script where the server is run, it outputs its logic on the webpage which is convenient for the developer. The error shows that it does not find the file `footer.ejs`.
- Found the typo in the file name, it was `footer` changed to `footer.ejs`. The following is displayed on `localhost:3000`.

![localhost-02.jpg](images\\docs\\localhost-02.jpg)<br>
*figure-8*

The above result shows that the home page is displayed successfully on the given port. But the desired result is not achieved yet. The reason being that we have not supplied our styles. Before we write the styles for the home page we would examine what is written in above layouts.

**index.ejs** contents: This `index.ejs` file is an EJS (Embedded JavaScript) template used to render the homepage of an Express.js application. The code is examined below.

1. `<%- include('layout/head.ejs'); %>`: Includes the content of the `head.ejs` file located in the `layout` directory. This contains the HTML head section, including metadata, CSS links, and the opening `<body>` tag.

2. `<%- include('layout/loginheader.ejs'); %>`: Includes the content of the `loginheader.ejs` file located in the `layout` directory. It represents the header section of the homepage, which  includes navigation links to login and Signup pages.

3. `<main></main>`: Defines the main content section of the homepage. At this stage it is empty.
`<%- include('layout/footer.ejs'); %>`: Includes the content of the `footer.ejs` file located in the `layout` directory. This represents the footer section of the homepage, which may include links, copyright information, or other footer content.

4. `<script src="bootstrap-5.0.2/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>`: Loads the Bootstrap JavaScript file (`bootstrap.bundle.min.js`) from the local `bootstrap-5.0.2` directory. This script provides functionality such as dropdowns, modals, and other Bootstrap components.

5. `</body>` and `</html>`: Closes the HTML body and HTML document tags, respectively.

**loginheader.ejs** contents: The `loginheader.ejs` file represents the header section of a webpage.

1. `<body>`: The opening `<body>` tag, which signifies the start of the HTML body section.
2. `<header>`: Defines the header section of the webpage, usually containing navigation links or brand name along with brand logo or icon.

The following 1,2 and numbered 3 lines contains CSS ( Cascading Style Sheets ) classes, since bootstrap responsive design is used, its `container` class is used.

1. `<div class="container">`: Creates a container to hold the header content, ensuring proper alignment and spacing.
2. `<div class="row">`: Defines a row within the container to organize content horizontally using the Bootstrap grid system.
3. `<div class="col">`: Creates a column within the row to hold the branding or title of the webpage.
4. `<h3>`: Defines a level 3 heading element (`<h3>`) to display some text. In this case, it represents the name of the website `Verbal Reasoning`.
5. `<div class="col-auto">`: This class allows the contents to adjust their width based on content.
6. `<a href="/login" class="anchor"> Login</a>`: Defines an anchor (`<a>`) element representing a navigation link to the login page. The `href` attribute specifies the URL to navigate to when clicked, and the `class="anchor"` class will be used for styling purposes which has yet been written.
7. `<a href="/signup" class="anchor"> Signup</a>`: Another anchor element representing a navigation link to the signup page. Similar to the login link, it has an `href` attribute pointing to the signup page and a `class="anchor"` class for styling which is to be written.

 At this stage, it would be a better idea to examine how HTML tags, elements or headings are constructed. Every HTML tag or element is treated as an object, which has its properties. These properties, in turn, may include attributes." For example, in `head.ejs` file a meta tag is used `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`. The `<meta>` is an HTML object and has many properties, among them are `name`, `content` and `initial-scale` in turn these are assigned specific attributes. This is how HTML object or elements are constructed.

- Similarly the `footer.ejs` contents are same and have been discussed above, with one exception that it shows the different text or message.

### Applying Styles Using styles.css (4.3.4) 

- As we have seen in figure-8 that our footer is not aligned to the bottom of the page. The reason being that the header or the footer tags are HTML semantics tags which allows user to use them in their code to convey the meaning of the HTML elements, it is the job of the developer to provide its styles. Following code is written in `styles.css`
  
```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

header {
  background-color: #b4b4e5;
  color: #171717;
  padding: 0px;
  text-align: center;
  display: flex; /* Use flexbox */
  align-items: center; /* Vertically center items */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute items horizontally */
  height:50px;
 
}

footer {
  background-color: #b4b4e5;
  color: #171717;
  padding: 0px;
  text-align: center;
  display: flex; /* Use flexbox */
  align-items: center; /* Vertically center items */
  justify-content: space-between; /* Distribute items horizontally */ 
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  height:70px;
}
```

- When above styles are applied the shape of our application is shown in the figure below.

![localhost-03](images\\docs\\localhost-03.jpg)<br>
*figure-9*

- The comments presented in the styles defines the code reason. The footer is attached to the bottom using `position:fixed` styles while both header and the footer are given their heights as well.
- From the figure-9 above it can be seen that both `Login` and `Signup` text is shown but does not have any styles, since both of them are provided with a class name "anchor", its styles are written now. Following styles are applied to the CSS class `.anchor`.
  
```css
.anchor{
  font-size: 18px;
  background-color: #b4b4e5;
  color: #171717;
  padding: 0px 15px 0px 15px; /* top, right, bottom, left */

}
```

- The padding values makes sure that there is some distance present between the items.

### Applying Bootstrap Icons in Header (4.3.5)

- Since the page is presented to the user to login or register, it is a good idea to have some icons presented here. Three different icons are used in loginheader template, their respective classes are shown below.

```html
//loginheader.ejs
<body>
  <header>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <h3>
              <span class="bi bi-lock-fill"></span>
              Verbal Reasoning
            </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="col-auto">
            <a href="/login" class="anchor"><i class="bi bi-key-fill"></i> Login</a>
            <a href="/signup" class="anchor"><i class="bi bi-arrow-bar-up"></i> Signup</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
  </header>
```

- The state of the application is shown below in figure-10.

![localhost-05](images\\docs\\localhost-05.jpg)<br>
*figure-10*

- To make sure that our design is responsive we move the size of the window by dragging and enlarging to the full screen size, it is noted that the contents are behaving as designed. The text in header and footer always aligned to the center of the container. It is shown in the next figure.

![localhost-06](images\\docs\\localhost-06.jpg)<br>
*figure-11*

> Note: Application home page is successfully implemented using bootstrap class to control the styles and ejs templating engine to write html and rendering them by express server.

- Before moving ahead to the next page design, a `favicon` will be added to the website and the title of the website will be changed dynamically. In figure-11 it can be seen that the application tab has no icon and the title is still shown `Express`.
- Created an online icon for the tab of size `16X16` and saved as `favicon.ico` in the root of the website which is a public directory from where it is rendered by express.
- To change the title of the page we edit the homepage router file contents. As it is the `index.ejs` which is rendered when users goes to our website, in express the route that handles this request is present in our `routes` folder named `index.js`. The modified contents are shown below.

```js
// index.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Verbal Reasoning for 11+'}); /* title is changed to 11+ */ 
});

module.exports = router;
```

The following figure shows the different title and favicon in the title of the webpage.

![localhost-07](images\\docs\\localhost-07.jpg)<br>
*figure-12*

---

### Adding Login and Signup pages (4.3.6) 

- Two files are created `login.ejs` and `signup.ejs` in `views` folder where home page layout `index.ejs` is already present.
- Following the design shown in [figure-1](#design-part-a), first a template file named `normalheader.ejs`is created which will be injected in both login and signup template.
- The contents of the `normalheader.ejs` is shown below.

```html
// normalheader.ejs

<body>
    <header>
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
            <h3><i class="bi bi-lock-fill"></i>Verbal Reasoning</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </header>
```

- The above code does not show either login or signup options as it is rendered within these pages.
- Initially The contents of the `login.ejs` is shown below.
  
```html
// login.ejs

<%- include('layout/head.ejs'); %>
    <body>
        <%- include('layout/normalheader.ejs'); %>
        <div class="container">
            <div>
                <h1>Login</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <%- include('layout/footer.ejs'); %>
    </body>
</html>
```

- Though the contents of the page is created but its route is not present in the route directory. Therefore a file name `login.js` is created in `routes` folder. The contents to handle the incoming GET request when user press the Login option from the home page is shown below.

```js
// login.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET login page. */
router.get('/login', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('login',{ title: 'Login' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

- Though the route logic is provided but we have to make an entry into `app.js` so that it knows about this route. There are two entries made, first `loginRouter` is declared at the top along with already predefine `indexRouter`, using `var loginRouter = require('./routes/login');` then adding the middleware part by telling `app.js` to use this logic `app.use('/', loginRouter);`. In the above code it can be seen when this page is displayed, the title value is also provided and it will be updated automatically.
- At this stage server is running and shows the login page.

![localhost-08](images\\docs\\localhost-08.jpg)<br>
*figure-13*

- Now we further modify the `login.ejs` file and add form contents to be filled by the user. Contents are shown below.

```html
// login.ejs

<%- include('layout/head.ejs'); %>
<body>
<%- include('layout/normalheader.ejs'); %>
<div class="container form-border">
  <div class="">
    <h1>Login</h1>
    <!-- LOGIN FORM -->
    <form action="/login" method="post">
    <!-- Label for Name -->
      <label for="name">Name:</label>
      <input type="text" id="name" name="username" placeholder="Enter your name" required autocomplete="off"
        class="form-control">
    <!-- Label for Email -->
      <label for="email">Email:</label>
      <input type="text" id="email" name="useremail" placeholder="Enter your email" required autocomplete="off"
        class="form-control">
    <!-- Label for Password -->
      <label for="password">Password:</label>
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" class="form-control" required>
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-warning btn-lg">Login</button>
    </form>
    <hr>
    <p>Need an account? <a href="/signup">Signup</a> Or go <a href="/">home</a>.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<%- include('layout/footer.ejs'); %>
  </body>
  </html>
```

- Following is a snapshot of the localhost showing login page.

![localhost-09](images\\docs\\localhost-09.jpg)<br>
*figure-14*

- In above snapshot, the fields of the form grows in full screen mode, to avoid this happening boot strap classes `col-sm-6` in the div just below the container. Also to provide the border to its parent container making a CSS class `.form-border`. By making this amendment lengths of the form fields are controlled.

![localhost-10](images\\docs\\localhost-10.jpg)<br>
*figure-15*

- Signup page is not added yet, if it is clicked express server sends the request to get it, since it is not present we get the error. The developing setup shows this scenario by telling us `404` error.

![terminal-output-01](images\\docs\\terminal-output-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-16*

To add the Signup page following steps are taken:

  1. Informs `app.js` to use this route, by declaring a `signupRouter = require('./routes/signup');` variable and assigning the `./routes/signup` by giving its directory address.
  2. A middleware `app.use('/', signupRouter);` is added in `app.js` to inform that this route is to be used for signup request
  3. A new file is created under `routes` folder named `signup.js` to handle the request. The code renders the `signup.ejs` template and sends the response back to the browser with the template content along with the title of the page `Signup`.
  4. A new file `signup.ejs` is created and the contents are provided, since they are same as of `login.ejs` they are not discussed in detail. It differs in only one way that it also adds the `Confirm password` label and field.

```js
// signup.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
/* GET Signup page. */
router.get('/signup', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('signup',{ title: 'Signup' });
});
module.exports = router;
```

- The above shows the `signup.js` router contents while the snapshot of the signup page is shown below.

![localhost-11](images\\docs\\localhost-11.jpg)<br>
*figure-17*

- A commit is made indicating the changes. First we take the state of our stage using `git st` shown below and make a commit. Also removed `.form-group` classes and unnecessary `divs` from both files, they were introduced to give styles but not used.

```git
git st
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   Readme.md
        modified:   views/login.ejs
        modified:   views/signup.ejs

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed) 
        public/images/docs/local-machine.jpg
        public/images/docs/localhost-12.jpg
        public/images/docs/version.jpg

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

- Design Part-A step-1 is achieved which consisted of providing a user interface.

### Testing UI (4.3.7) 

- Three browsers `Google chrome, Microsoft edge and mozilla firefox are used`.
  
1. When home page  is seen in full width using above browsers, they all show contents are displayed in the center and both Login and Signup links are displayed with icon.
2. When the size is changed horizontally to the minimum width, `Edge and Chrome` displays the header text in one line but `firefox` behaves differently as shown in the following figure.

- To avoid it happening the `.anchor` class property ` padding: 0px 10px 0px 10px; /* top, right, bottom, left */` values were changed from `15` to `10`. The problem is corrected. as shown below.

## Implementing Design Part-A  Step-2: Setting up Database Locally and Online (4.4) 

- Mongodb server and clients utilities are installed on the local machine. Two client utilities are installed one is a mongo shell called `mongosh` and second one is GUI called `Compass`.
- Both are shown to be running in the following figure. Mongo shell can be opened in Compass or separately

![mongosh-compass.jpg](images\\docs\\mongosh-compass.jpg)<br>
*figure-25*



- An online account is created using a usr name `sullisayyed21@outlook.com` with a  cluster name `usersName0` shown below.

![atlas-online.jpg](images\\docs\\atlas-online.jpg)<br>
*figure-26*


- A database named `vrusers` is created locally and online. This database contains a collection name `credentials` where the details of the user will be added.
- A Database user is added giving a role of admin to handle with this database online, password and user name is set.
- At first newly created database name `vrusers's` collection is empty. It is to be filled when user register on the site.
- To connect to a local mongodb server the address is provided from `Compass` client utility it is `mongodb://localhost:27017/vrusers`. As it can be seen that we are providing the database name `vrusers` in the end of the URL to connect to the right address.
- Similarly to connect to online server, the online Atlas server has provided the connection string it is shown below.

```txt
mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@usersname0.r4rl0vd.mongodb.net/vrusers?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=usersName0
```

- In the above string user and password fields to be filled in our application, this string also points to the database we intend to use.
- To connect the application to a local or online server node `mongoose` module is installed in the project using `npm i mongoose`.
- Though local and online server are setup to be used yet no code is present in our app to start the mongoose service from the application. To do so first we need to provide configuration settings. To do so, a file name `connection.js` is created in a new folder called `dbconfig`. Following are the contents of `connection.js`

```js
// connection.js

const mongoose = require("mongoose");

// Load env variable from .env file
require('dotenv').config();
//console.log(process.env);

connectMongoDb = function () {
    try {
        const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI 
        if (!uri) {
            throw new Error("MONGODB_URI environment variable is not defined");
        }
        mongoose.set('strictQuery', false);
        const connect = mongoose.connect(uri);
        console.log(`Connected to  MongoDB database!`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Mongo Error:", error);
    }
}
// Exporting the whole function to be used in another module.
module.exports = connectMongoDb;
```

- The above code provide the logic to connect the application to the local or online Database server. This function is exported to be used in application and started from the `app.js` file.

> Note: The string provided by the mongodb Atlas online app is not to be exposed on GitHub, as it can be seen by others. So to avoid this it is stored in an `.env` file which is not pushed to the GitHub. To avoid it being pushed, its entry is made in `.gitignore` file. When a Web App is hosted in the clouds on any platform, it is provided directly to that host.

- To store the database connection string securely nodejs library `dotenv` is used by first installing it into our project using `npm i dotenv`. The first line in above code `require('dotenv').config()` automatically loads the variable ( connection string ) from the `.env` file into local machine's running `process.env`.
- The connection string is stored in `.env` file as shown below.

```txt
MONGODB_URI='mongodb+srv://sulli:21March@usersname0.r4rl0vd.mongodb.net/vrusers?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=usersName0'
```

- Since for testing and development process a local host string is used which is later on replaced by the above.

```txt
MONGODB_URI='mongodb://localhost:27017/vrusers'
```

### Establishing database connection from the application (4.4.1)

To start the mongoose server from our application two lines are added at the top section of  `app.js` file and one in the middle. To start this service  `connectMongoDb();` function is used. This function is exported exported by `dbconfig/connection.js` file and it is loaded or required in `app.js`.

```js
// app.js

var createError = require('http-errors');
var express = require('express');
var path = require('path');
var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
var logger = require('morgan');
require('dotenv').config(); // new lines added
var connectMongoDb = require('./dbconfig/connection'); // new lines added
...........
connectMongoDb(); // connects the application to database server
```

- Following message is shown on the terminal assuring that successful connection is established.

```txt
> h446@0.0.0 dev
> nodemon --ext js,ejs,json,css ./bin/www

[nodemon] 3.1.0
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`

[nodemon] starting `node ./bin/www`
Connected to online MongoDB database!
[nodemon] restarting due to changes...
[nodemon] starting `node ./bin/www`
Connected to  MongoDB database!

```

### Adding a User Schema for the Database (4.4.2) 

- The structure of the database depends upon the schema and it is to be added in our application. To do so a `schema` is to be created which provided a skeleton of the fields that are to be created. This is our modal in terms of express `MVC` architecture.
- For this purpose we create a folder name `modal` under `h446` working directory and in this modal a file name `user.js` is created which will represent the modal. Following are the contents of the `user.js`:

```js
// user.js 

var mongoose = require("mongoose");

var loginSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        lowercase: true,
        unique: true,
        index: true
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        lowercase: true,
        unique: true,
        index: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
}, { timestamps: true });

const collection = mongoose.model('credentials', loginSchema);

module.exports = collection;
```

- The code `mongoose.model('credentials', loginSchema);` using the `mongoose` library add `loginSchema`. The collection name of our `vrusers` database  `credentials` is also passed to be used with.
- The handle or reference is provided to a variable name `collection` which is exported to be used in other modules, where it will be required.

> Note: So far we have setup a database system locally and online, crated a database name `vrusers` with one collection named `credentials`. The application connection has been established. Now the code logic is to be added into the app so that when user enters the detail to register, it is added into our local or online database.

### Handling Incoming POST Request (4.4.3)

- In our application views and routes are present a modal has also been created yet we do not have controller. It is time to implement MVC architecture fully to keep the code modular and maintainable this approach also adheres to the separation of concern principle where each component  (routes, controllers, models) has its specific role and responsibility.
- A `controllers` folder is created and two files are added `loginController.js and signupController.js`.
- When `Submit` button is pressed by the user, a Post request is sent to `/signup` route or `/login` route depending where it is pressed from. The above two files will handle these POST requests. A new module name `bcrypt` is to be used to provide the hashing mechanisms, so it is installed using `npm i bcrypt`.
- No user exist initially, they need to register first so starting with `signupController.js` a modal is imported to work with on the top along with another module which will be used for hashing the password to make is secured. Following shows the contents of a `signupController.js`

```js
// Signup controller

var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
var collection = require('../model/users');

// Handler function that deals with POST
const handleRegisterRequest = async (req, res) => {
  console.log('Entered in signup controller:');
  try {
    // Validate input fields
    const { username, useremail, password } = req.body;
    if (!username || !useremail || !password) {
      return res.status(400).send("Please provide all required fields.");
    }

    // Check if user or email already exists
    const existingUser = await collection.findOne({ name: username });
    const existingEmail = await collection.findOne({ email: useremail });
    if (existingUser) {
      return res.status(400).send("User already exists. Please choose a different username.");
    }
    if (existingEmail) {
      return res.status(400).send("Email already exists. Please choose a different email.");
    }

    // Hash password and save user data
    const saltRounds = 10; // Number of salt rounds for bcrypt
    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
    const userData = await collection.create({
      name: username,
      email: useremail,
      password: hashedPassword
    });
    console.log("User registered:", userData);
    res.render('login', { title: 'Login' });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during signup:", error);
    res.status(500).send("An error occurred during signup. Please try again later.");
  }
};

module.exports = {
  handleRegisterRequest
};
```

In the above code, [asynchronous](#appendix-c) function named `handlePostRequest` is created, it does five jobs:

1. First check if incoming data present in POST `req.body` exists or not if not sent `400` notification with the message. To check the data mongoose api `findOne` is used.
2. Second checks both user name and email, if exists again sends the message back to the user.
3. Third by using `bcrypt` node module hashed the password with recommended 10 rounds.
4. Then using mongodb api on `collection` model apply `create` function using all parameters. This `create` function adds the data into the database collection named `credentials`.
5. Once a user is registered, it is directed to `login` page again to login into the site. Errors are handled accordingly.

- For the above function to work, we need to inform the `signup` route to delegate the responsibility of handling POST request to this function so a new line `router.post(/'signup', signupController.handleRegisterRequest)` is injected into `signup.js` route.
  
![localdatabase-empty](images\\docs\\localdatabase-empty.jpg)<br>
*figure-26*

### Registering User from the Signup Page (4.4.4)

- The app is running on port 3000, and first user signs up to the site, when submit button is pressed, the data is entered successfully into local database name `vrusers`. MonogoDB is a non relational database that records what is called `documents` in `collections`. Here first document is created, it is shown below.

![data-added-01](images\\docs\\data-added-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-27*

> Note: The application uses `console.log()` extensively to make sure that when code is executed, it keeps the programmers well informs of the activities. The code shown above in `signupController.js` also uses `console.log()` function to log the data on console, it is shown below.

```txt
Entered in signup controller:
User registered: {
  name: 'sulaiman sayyed',
  email: 'sullisayyed21@outlook.com',
  password: '$2b$10$MolVGPwSF963lib.c9PRg.ZSTJ8YG0eVJ5p3B6lzwOgaJNI.o04Z6',
  _id: new ObjectId('661b2739ade0a28f9a1352c8'),
  createdAt: 2024-04-14T00:45:45.301Z,
  updatedAt: 2024-04-14T00:45:45.301Z,
  __v: 0
}
POST /signup 200 144.009 ms - 2270
```

- The hash password is shown as it has been hashed by the code. The code having shown the data on console takes the user to `login` page so that one can login to the site.

#### Testing Registration Process From Local Database  (4.4.4.1)

This test is done when nodejs express server is running locally on `port:3000` and connected to local instance of mongodb client application called `Compasss`.

1. When the same name is tried to register and tested locally, it successfully sends the string back from its controller `signupController`. The string is shown in the header of the browser, where user neters the address to navigate. This string is shown below.

```txt
Email already exists. Please choose a different email.
```

The above happens because of this logic present in the code.

```js
//signupController.js

if (existingEmail) {
      return res.status(400).send("Email already exists. Please choose a different email.");
    }
```

### Logging the user (4.4.6)

To handle POST request coming from login page,  `login.js` route is amended to delegates all incoming POST request to `loginController`. It is done by adding the following code.

```js
// login route

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var loginController = require('../controllers/loginController'); //new line added
/* GET login page. */
router.get('/login', function (req, res, next) {
  res.render('login', { title: 'Login' });
});

/* Delegate the responsibility to the login controller*/
router.post('/login', loginController.handleRegisterRequest); // new line added
module.exports = router;
```

- The code to handle POST requests is shown below in `loginController.js`

```js
// Login Controller

var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
var collection = require('../modal/user');

const handleLoginRequest = async (req, res) => {
  console.log("Entered In login controller");
  try {
    const checkUser = await collection.findOne({ name: req.body.username });
    if (!checkUser) {
      return res.redirect('/login?error=user_not_found');
    }

    const checkEmail = await collection.findOne({ email: req.body.useremail });
    if (!checkEmail) {
      return res.redirect('/login?error=email_not_found');
    }

    try {
      const isPasswordMatch = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, checkUser.password);
      if (isPasswordMatch) {
        return res.render('dashboard', { title: 'Dashboard' });

      } else {
        return res.redirect('/login?error=wrong_password');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error comparing passwords:", error);
      return res.send('Error during login. Please try again.');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during login:", error);
    return res.send('Error during login. Please try again.');
  }
};

module.exports = {
  handleLoginRequest
};
```

#### Testing Login procedure (4.4.6.1)

The above code using mongoose module library uses `findOne()` methods to find the user name and email in the database against the message coming in the `req.body.username`. If it fails it sends back the proper message in the header to inform the user of what information is wrong. Similarly the module `bcrypt.compare()` API compares the entered password with the password already present in the database and gives the result. Errors are shown to the user in the address bar.

```txt
http://localhost:3000/login?error=user_not_found
http://localhost:3000/login?error=email_not_found
http://localhost:3000/login?error=wrong_password
```

- When login procedure is completed, the `dashboard` page is rendered. A new template `dashboard.ejs` is created in a `views` folder.  Also, a new route is created under `route` folder named `dashboard.js` both contents are shown below. The contents of dashboard will change with some message and links.

```html
// dashboard.ejs

<%- include('layout/head.ejs'); %>
    <body>
        <%- include('layout/normalheader.ejs'); %>
            <body>
                <h1> Welcome to Application Dashboard!</h1>
                <%- include('layout/footer.ejs'); %>
            </body>
            </html>
```

```js
// dashboard route
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET dashboard page. */
router.get('/dashboard', function (req, res, next) {
    console.log('Entered in dashboard Router');
  res.render('dashboard', { title: 'Dashboard' });
});
module.exports = router;
```
### Registering the User on Online Database (4.4.7)

- The connection string in `.env` file is changed to point to the online database name `vruser` and a new user is added. By using `console.log()`, it is printed to console to make sure that local machine register the environment variable. The log below, third line shows it is successfully loaded into the machine environment. The message `connected to online Mongo database is shown`.


```bash
LOCALAPPDATA: 'C:\\Users\\books\\AppData\\Local',
LOGONSERVER: '\\\\SAS-DESKTOP',
MONGODB_URI:    <--- Variable inserted in local environment
'mongodb+srv://sulli:<password>@usersname0.r4rl0vd.mongodb.net/vrusers?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=usersName0',
NODE: 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe',
NODE_EXE: 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\\\node.exe',
NPM_CLI_JS: 'C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node_modules\\npm\\bin\\npm-cli.js',
npm_command: 'run-script',
XML_CATALOG_FILES: 'file:///W:/miniconda3/etc/xml/catalog',
_CONDA_EXE: 'W:\\miniconda3\\Scripts\\conda.exe',
_CONDA_ROOT: 'W:\\miniconda3'

Connected to  online MongoDB database!
```

- Following figure shows the newly added data to online database. This time in name field `Sulaiman` is entered. The project name online was also changed to `VERBAL-REASONING` separately.

![online-data-added-02.jpg](images\\docs\\online-data-added-02.jpg)</br>
*figure-28*

Upon successful registration it is redirected to login page where the same credentials were entered and it takes us to dashboard page.

> Note: In this phase both local and online database were shown to be connected by using different environment string saved in `.env` file. The user were registered locally and online and the dashboard page is successfully rendered.


<dev class="page"/>


## Implementing Design Part-B Step-1: Creating Dashboard and Practice page (4.5)

When user successfully logged in, it is redirected to `Dashboard` page. This page will take him to either to practice the test or or to take a test. It only contains tow links to take the user to other pages. Its design and details are not given below and can be see in online repo. The following state digram shows the simple scenario.

```mermaid
stateDiagram 
    [*] --> AppStarted
    AppStarted --> LoginOrRegister
    LoginOrRegister --> Dashboard
    Dashboard --> Practice
    Dashboard --> Test
```

The dashboard page initially job is to provide the option to the user, which would take him to the practice/play ground page ot to the test page.
  
![playground-01.jpg](images\\docs\\playground-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-29*

- The above diagram shows different phases of the practice page which is labelled as `Playground`.
- It consist of UI design consisting of `header` as in other previous pages and a footer. There is a dropdown menu present in the header which shows the list of topic available to practice. Just below the header a message is shown with some instructions about the lesson being displayed.
-  When a topic is chosen by the user , it adds four buttons to display the lessons, and when lesson is pressed accordion is used to display different questions which are scrollable and presents the choice to the user.
-  At the bottom there is an answer button which tells if the user has been successful or not.

#### Designing and Implementing the Practice Page (4.5.1)

- Besides header and footer it has four main parts followed by a link to navigate to the previous page. 

```html
//practice.ejs
<main id="accordion-page" class="container">
<div class="accordion-topic"><label for="topic" id="topicid">Choose The topic</label></div>
<!-- place holder for message -->
<div class="row">
    <div class="mx-auto">
        <div class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-evenly">
 <!-- create four button to show the lessons -->          
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

1. The `<div>` with unique id `topicid` and a class `.d-flex` is used in the script to get the handle to these placeholders and UI elements are injected dynamically. The reason being that the contents of the heading and number of lessons and the message shown on the message bar depends upon the data which is independent of the `view`.

2. To structure questions and answers, an accordion component of the bootstrap is used. To avoid being written 10 times manually, an `ejs for` loop is used. Similarly, all these items are to be injected with data, requiring to have a need of refereeing to them. Their unique `ids` are also build using `.ejs`. For example `<Label for="q-<%= i %>-optional">` builds `Label` elements attributes dynamically using a for loop. It is shown below.

```html
//practice.ejs
<div class="accordion mt-4">
<% for (let i=1; i <=10; i++) { %>
<div class="accordion-item" id="accord-item-<%= i %>">
  <h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading<%= i %>">
<button id="q-<%= i %>" class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
  data-bs-target="#collapse<%= i %>" aria-expanded="true"
  aria-controls="collapse<%= i %>">
 <!-- placeholder for question -->
  Questions
</button>
 <div id="collapse<%= i %>" class="accordion-collapse collapse"
      aria-labelledby="heading<%= i %>">
<div class="accordion-body">
<ul class="list-group">
<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" id="q-<%= i %>-option1">
<label for="q-<%= i %>-option1">words<!-- placeholder --></label>
</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" id="q-<%= i %>-option2">
<label for="q-<%= i %>-option2">words<!-- placeholder --></label>
</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" id="q-<%= i %>-option3">
<label for="q-<%= i %>-option3">words<!-- placeholder --></label>
</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" id="q-<%= i %>-option4">
<label for="q-<%= i %>-option4">words<!-- placeholder --></label>
</li>
<li class="list-group-item"><input type="checkbox" id="q-<%= i %>-option5">
<label for="q-<%= i %>-option5">words<!-- placeholder --></label>
</li>
</ul>
<button id="answer-q-<%= i %>-btn" class="btn btn-primary mt-3"
   onclick="checkAnswer('q-<%= i %>')">Answer</button>
</div>
  </div>
 </div>
 <% } %>
</div>
```

To use above structure and be filled with values two scripts are used and mentioned at the bottom of this file as shown below. The button element `button` giving every button a unique id is also attached with `onClick` event handler which is used in the scripts.

```html
//practice.ejs
<!-- Link to JavaScript file -->
<script src="../javascripts/topicScript.jst"></script>
<script src="../javascripts/practiceScript.js"></script>
</html>
```

The above scripts named `topicScript.js` and `practiceScript.js` are created under `public/javascripts/` directory. The first script reads a file named `topics.json` and traverse through the data and upon finding a unique object `topics.lessons.title` reads its value and fills in a list of topics which is made dynamically on the fly for the user to select the topics. A dropdown item is shown below. This script `topicScript.js` is used by both pages `practice.ejs and test.ejs`. When creating some buttons, it checks to see call is coming from which page.

![topic-dropdown-01.jpg](images\\docs\\topic-dropdown-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-*

 When `practice.ejs` template is loaded number of  interactions happens which are indicated by the numbers in sequenceDiagram shown below. DOM functions used are described in [Appendix-D](#appendix-d)

> Note: Interaction number 4 shows that the page gets a reference to a unique id named `topicList`, it is present in a header section of this practice page. Then the dynamically generated list is attached to the header.
 
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant DOM
    participant topicScript.js
    participant topics.json

    DOM->>topicScript.js: Call populateDropdown()
    topicScript.js->>topicScript.js: Clear dropdown list
    topicScript.js->>topics.json: Fetch topics data from JSON file
    topicScript.js->>topicScript.js: Get reference from header `id=topicList` for the list to be attached

    topicScript.js->>topicScript.js: Implements handling, attach unique handlers
    topicScript.js->>topicScript.js: Populate dropdown list
    topicScript.js->> DOM: Render dropdown list
```

To fetch the data from a JSON file, code used is shown below with comments. It uses a promise and returns the read JSON object from the file. If there is an error, returns only an empty array `[]`.

```js
//topicScript.JS 
// Function to fetch topics data from JSON file
async function fetchTopicsData() {
// Start fetching the JSON file
  try {
    const response = await fetch('./data/topics.json');
     // Parse the response as JSON
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching JSON:', error);
    return { topics: [] };
  }
}
```

When user clicks on topic item, it goes through number of activities and either create four buttons for the lessons or if does not find the lesson says not implemented. The code snippets from `topicScript.js` shown below. All code for the app can be downloaded from the online repository.

```js
// topicScript.js
// Function to create lesson buttons dynamically
function createLessonButtons(topic, title) {
  const buttonContainer = document.querySelector('.d-flex');
  buttonContainer.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous buttons
  // Set the topic description
  const descriptionElement = document.getElementById('topicid');
  descriptionElement.textContent = topic.description;
  const hasFourLessons = topic.lessons && topic.lessons.length === 4;
  const isTestPage = document.getElementById('testPage');
  if (hasFourLessons) {
    if (!isTestPage) {
      createLessonButtonsForFourLessons(topic, title);
    } else {
      createGenerateQuestionButton(topic, title);
      createStartTestButton(topic, title);
    }
  } else {
    const noLessonButton = createButton("Lesson Not Implemented", () => { });
    buttonContainer.appendChild(noLessonButton);
  }
}
```
- To create four lesson buttons for each lesson following function is used. This function takes help from other helper function both are shown below.
  
```js
// topicScript.js
// Function to create four lessons on practice page
function createLessonButtonsForFourLessons(topic, title) {
  const buttonGroup = document.createElement('div');
  buttonGroup.classList.add('btn-group', 'd-flex');
  const lessons = topic.lessons;
  lessons.forEach((lesson) => {
    const buttonText = "Lesson " + lesson.lesson_number;
    const onClick = () => handleButtonClick(topic, title, lesson.lesson_number);
    const buttonId = `lesson-${lesson.lesson_number}-btn`;
    const button = createButton(buttonText, onClick, buttonId);
    buttonGroup.appendChild(button);
    const buttonContainer = document.querySelector('.d-flex');
    buttonContainer.appendChild(buttonGroup);
  });
}
// Function to create a button with specified text, click handler, and ID
function createButton(text, onClick, id) {
  const button = document.createElement('button');
  button.href = '#';
  button.classList.add('btn', 'btn-outline-secondary', 'flex-fill', 'lessons');
  button.textContent = text;
  button.addEventListener('click', onClick);
  if (id) {
    button.id = id;
  }
  return button;
}
```

The script `topicScript.js` also makes three calls to outside files to be handled. The reason being that this script is shared between `practiceScript.js` and `testScript.js`. These two scripts provides functionality for two different purpose, one is used in practising while the other is used in taking a test. The third call which is handled by `recordtestScript.js` is the one which records all the activity when test button is pressed.

```

The above sequenceDiagram shows that `topicScript.js` invoke three functions present in another file called `practiceScript.js, testScript.js and recordtestScript.js`. These files handle and implement these functions as needed. 

#### Populating Questions from the topic.json File (4.5.2)

To understand the process of populating the questions and the code used to populate each question, the data  arrangement in `topic.json` kept in JSON format is shown below.

```json
//topic.json
{
    "topics": [
        {
            "id": "_1",
            "title": "Opposites",
            "description": "Choose  the most opposites words in meaning",
            "lessons": [
                {
                    "lesson_number": 1,
                    "questions": [
                        {
                            "id": "q-1",
                            "words": [
                                "ability",
                                "capable",
                                "inability",
                                "liability",
                                "real"
                            ],
                            "answer": [
                                "ability",
                                "inability"
                            ]
```

There are ten different topics, each topic title is denoted by the field `title` or `Key:value` pair. The `Opposites` being the first topic. The topic `Opposites` has four lessons, every lesson accessed as `topics.lessons.lesson_number` by traversing from the top to reach a particular item.
  
Similarly every lesson_number has 10 unique questions kept in an array. And each question has two arrays one for `words` and one for the correct answer as `answer`.

> Note: Not only accordion component being a place holder is drawn dynamically first by using `.ejs` template but now it is being populated dynamically when the call comes to get this job done to `practiceScript.js`.

When a user clicks on the topic say `Opposites` from the dropdown list.

![topic-dropdown-02.jpg](images\\docs\\topic-dropdown-02.jpg)<br>

Four buttons gets created on the fly, as each topic has four lessons.

![topic-dropdown-03.jpg](images\\docs\\topic-dropdown-03.jpg)<br>

Though the buttons to generate the lessons have been created but the accordion is empty as shown in figure below.

![localhost-13.jpg](images\\docs\\localhost-13.jpg)

And when from these lessons, user clicks on any lesson, say `Lesson-1` indicated by a button, then all the questions present in that particular lessons are populated in the accordion using a `ForEach` loop applied on array object as shown in code snippet given below.

```js
//practiceScript.js
let  topics = {}; // to hold the reference to the data object
let lessonName;  // to hold the lesson name being passed
let lessonNumber; // to hold the lesson number
let correctAnswer = []; // to hold answer given in data or file
let selectedLabels = []; // to hold user selection

// Function to populate questions in the accordion
function populateQuestions(topic, title, clickedLesson) {
    topics = topic;
    lessonName = title;
    lessonNumber = clickedLesson;
    const clickedLessonData = topic.lessons[clickedLesson - 1];
    clickedLessonData.questions.forEach(populateQuestion);
}
// Function to populate a single question in the accordion
const populateQuestion = (question) => {
    const words = question.words;
    const questionNumber = question.id;
    const questionButton = document.getElementById(questionNumber);
    questionButton.textContent = question.id;
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        const checkboxId = question.id + `-option${i + 1}`;
        const checkbox = document.getElementById(checkboxId);
        checkbox.nextElementSibling.textContent = words[i];
    }
};
```

#### Interacting with User Activities (4.5.3)

In above function a reference to the button clicked is passed with this argument `clickedLesson`. By using this information only specific data can be  referenced using `const clickedLessonData = topic.lessons[clickedLesson - 1];` instead of going through the whole data. To get to first lesson we need to choose `topic.lessons[0]` that is the first element of the array `lesson[0]`. As the argument `clickedLesson` represents the `lesson_number`. And to get to the first lesson being number `1` is represented by the index zero in an array, this subtraction is done `clickedLesson-1`.

Then by iterating all the questions present in clicked lesson, the data is read and populated in the accordion. The trick used to access to the right place holder is to use the correct `question.id` from the data and constructing checkboxId using a loop. Once it is constructed, the code `checkbox.nextElementSibling.textContent = words[i];` does the assignment of the words present in an array `words`.

When all the questions are populated, user can start to do the activity, for example in topic one being `opposites`, it is asked to selected two most opposites words. The answer can be checked promptly by clicking the answer button as a success or failure sound and the color of the answer button gets triggered. The rest of the code for `practiceScript.js` is shown below.

```js
//practice.js
// Function to retrieve the correct answers for a question
function retrieveCorrectAnswers(questionId) {
 topics.lessons.forEach((lesson) => {
  if (lesson.lesson_number === lessonNumber) {
      lesson.questions.forEach((question) => {
          if (question.id === questionId) {
              correctAnswer = question.answer;
          }
      });
  }
 });
}
// Function to handle the click event of the "Answer" button
function checkAnswer(questionId) {
retrieveCorrectAnswers(questionId);
getSelectedLabels()
const isCorrect = compareArrays(correctAnswer, selectedLabels);
const answerButton = document.getElementById("answer-" + questionId + "-btn")
if (isCorrect) {
    handleCorrectAnswer(answerButton);
} else {
    handleIncorrectAnswer(answerButton);
}
}
// Function to get the selected labels
function getSelectedLabels() {
selectedLabels = [];
const checkedBoxes = document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]:checked');
checkedBoxes.forEach((checkbox) => {
    selectedLabels.push(checkbox.labels[0].textContent);
});
}
// Function to handle a correct answer
function handleCorrectAnswer(answerButton) {
    answerButton.classList.add("btn-success");
    playSuccessSound();
    resetLabelsAndAnswers();
}
// Function to handle an incorrect answer
function handleIncorrectAnswer(answerButton) {
    answerButton.classList.add("btn-danger");
    playFailureSound();
    resetLabelsAndAnswers();
}
// Function to play a success sound
function playSuccessSound() {
    const successSound = new Audio("./sounds/success.wav");
    successSound.play();
}
// Function to play a failure sound
function playFailureSound() {
    const failureSound = new Audio("./sounds/buzz.wav");
    failureSound.play();
}
// Function to reset labels and answers
function resetLabelsAndAnswers() {
    selectedLabels = [];
    correctAnswer = [];
}
// Function to compare two arrays
function compareArrays(arr1, arr2) {
    if (arr1.length !== arr2.length) {
        return false;
    }
    const sortedArr1 = arr1.slice().sort();
    const sortedArr2 = arr2.slice().sort();
    for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr1.length; i++) {
        if (sortedArr1[i] !== sortedArr2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
// Function to handle accordion collapse
function handleAccordionCollapse(event) {
const accordionItem = event.target.closest('.accordion-item');
const checkboxes = accordionItem.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]');
checkboxes.forEach((checkbox) => {
    checkbox.checked = false;
});
}
// Function to handle accordion expand
function handleAccordionExpand(event) {
  const expandedItemId = event.target.getAttribute('aria-controls');
  closeOtherAccordionItems(expandedItemId);
}
// Function to close other accordion items
function closeOtherAccordionItems(expandedItemId) {
document.querySelectorAll('.accordion-item').forEach((item) => {
const itemId = item.querySelector('.accordion-collapse').getAttribute('id');
if (itemId !== expandedItemId) {
const collapse = bootstrap.Collapse.getInstance(item.querySelector('.accordion-collapse'));
 if (collapse) {
    collapse.hide();
  }
}
});
}
// Function to handle checkbox change event
function handleCheckboxChange(event) {
const checkedCheckboxes = document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]:checked');
if (checkedCheckboxes.length > 2) {
    event.target.checked = false;
    }
}
// Event listeners
document.querySelectorAll('.accordion-button').forEach((button) => {
button.addEventListener('click', handleAccordionExpand);
});
document.querySelectorAll('.accordion-item').forEach((item) => {
item.addEventListener('hidden.bs.collapse', handleAccordionCollapse);
});
document.querySelectorAll('input[type="checkbox"]').forEach((checkbox) => {
checkbox.addEventListener('change', handleCheckboxChange);
});
// End of file.
```

## Implementing Design Part-C Step-1: Creating Test Page (4.6)

The structure of both the practice and test pages remains largely unchanged. However, when the script `topicScript.js `detects a call from the `test.ejs` template, it dynamically generates two buttons: one to populate the questions and another to commence the test.

During the test phase, the user is presented with 20 questions instead of the usual 10. Upon pressing the Answer button, no immediate feedback is provided regarding the correctness of the selected choice. The layout of the accordion interface remains consistent throughout this process.

To enhance the test-taking experience, shuffling is implemented in the following sequence:
  1. Firstly, all four lessons undergo shuffling, ensuring that their original order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, and 4) is randomized.
  2. Subsequently, each lesson, containing 10 questions, is individually shuffled to ensure variety.
  3. A pool is then formed, housing all the questions in a randomized order. This approach enables the question generator to draw from a diverse set of questions.
   
With four lessons per topic, each containing 10 questions, the total pool available to the question generator comprises 40 questions. It's important to note that duplicate keys would exist within this pool ( but not the contents ). For instance, the initial question in each lesson is denoted as `q-1` and is replicated four times, as are subsequent questions.

From the pool of 40 questions, only 20 unique questions are selected. Furthermore, measures are implemented to prevent the re-selection of a question once it has been chosen randomly. This ensures a varied and engaging test-taking experience for the user.

### Shuffling Lessons (4.6.1)

1. When `Generate Questions` button is pressed, the call comes to `testScript.js` function `handleGenerateQuestions` shown below. 

```js
//testScript.js
function handleGenerateQuestions(topic, title) {
    try {
        const randomQuestions = generateRandomQuestions(topic, title);
        populateQuestions(randomQuestions);
        questionsGenerated = true;
        const buttonTemp = document.getElementById('generate-questions-btn');
        buttonTemp.disabled = true;
        disableAnswerButtons();
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('error in populating questions');
    }
}
```

2. This function in turns call `generateRandomQuestions` shown below which in truns call a function to shuffle the given array.

```js
// Define a function to generate questions for a given topic ID
function generateRandomQuestions(topicData, title) {
try { var lessons = [];
 if (topicData.title === title) {
     lessons = topicData.lessons;
 }
 // First shuffle the array 
 const shuffledLessons = shuffleArray(lessons);
 const selectedQuestions = [];
 // Iterate over each lesson
 for (let i = 0; i < shuffledLessons.length; i++) {
     const lesson = shuffledLessons[i];
     const shuffledQuestions = shuffleArray(lesson.questions);
     // Add first 10 questions to the selectedQuestions array
     const selected = shuffledQuestions.slice(0, 10);
     selected.forEach(question => {
         if (!selectedQuestions.some(q => q.answer === question.answer)) {
             selectedQuestions.push(question);
         }else {
                 console.log('duplicate tried to be pushed!!|');
         }
     });
     console.log(selectedQuestions);
 }
 // Ensure there are only 20 unique questions
 const uniqueQuestions = [];
 for (let i = 0; i < selectedQuestions.length; i++) {
     const question = selectedQuestions[i];
     if (!uniqueQuestions.some(q => q.answer === question.answer)) {
         uniqueQuestions.push(question);
     }else{
         console.log(' Same question is being pushed !!!');
     }
     if (uniqueQuestions.length === 20) {
         console.log(uniqueQuestions);
         break; // Break the loop once we have 20 unique questions
     }
 }
 // Generate and return the questions
 const shuffledUniqueQuestions = shuffleArray(uniqueQuestions);
 console.log(uniqueQuestions);
 shuffledUniqueQuestions.forEach(question => {
     const questionId = question.id;
     if (!questionsMap[questionId]) {
         questionsMap[questionId] = [];
     }
     questionsMap[questionId].push(question);
 });
 return shuffledUniqueQuestions;
} catch (err) {
    console.log("Error generating random questions:", err);
    return []; // Return an empty array if an error occurs
}
}

// Function to shuffle an array
function shuffleArray(array) {
    console.log('In shuffle array functions:');
    console.log('before shuffling ');
    console.log(array);
    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];
    }
    console.log('After shuffling :');
    console.log(array);
    return array;
}
```

It is this function which does number of jobs, the pseudocode is shown below.

```txt 
Activity: Generating Random Questions

1. User triggers random question generation by pressing  UI button
2. Call shuffleArray(lessons) to shuffle the items passed in an array.
3. Initialize selectedQuestions array.
4. Loop over shuffled items:
   a. Call shuffleArray(lesson.questions) to shuffle the questions array.
   b. Select the first 10  questions.
   c. Check if each question is unique.(though, not necessary yet added!)
   d. If unique, push the question to the selectedQuestions array.
5. Ensure there are only 20 unique questions.
6. Push the unique questions to the questionsMap.
7. Return the shuffledUniqueQuestions array.

```

Using developer mode and logging output following figures are acquired to show what happens during questions being generated.

![test-01.jpg](images\\docs\\test-01.jpg)<br>

The above shows that the lessons are present in memory as it is, when they were loaded form the JSON file, starting from `1-4`. Once they are shuffled, the state of the json object in memory is shown below.

![test-02.jpg](images\\docs\\test-02.jpg)<br>

Next each lesson is taken and its questions are shuffled. 

### Shuffling Questions Present in Each Lesson (4.6.2)

To hold the shuffled questions of each lesson, a local variable named `shuffledQuestions` is used in a for loop which runs four times, as only four lessons being present. It is done by using the `shuffleArray(lesson.questions)` function again passing questions this time. The following figure shows the state before and after shuffling.

![test-04.jpg](images\\docs\\test-04.jpg)<br>

These questions are to be stored in a new array, so a global variable `slectedQuestions[]` is used to hold these questions, a pool of all forty questions is created where all questions are shuffled completely as shown in the figure below. They no longer belong to any unique lesson but by being having a unique `Key:value` format the array would contain `id:q-1` at least four times so are other questions id being repeated four times.

![test-05.jpg](images\\docs\\test-05.jpg)<br>

### Selecting 20 Unique Question from the Pool (4.6.3)

Now only 20 questions are to be selected from the the pool, a local variable `uniqueQuestions[]` is declared  and first 20 questions have been chosen.

> Note: The idea to pickup random questions is to have them shuffled first and pick from the top of the stack. While picking up 20 questions it is also made sure that duplicate answer array having same contents is not present, which is not possible, as the data does not contain any answer that is repeated, but it is still checked.

Following shows 20 selected questions where each question with the same id is repeated twice by virtue of lessons sharing the `key:value` pair. The following figure also shows two questions of `id:q-4` having different words and answer.

![test-06.jpg](images\\docs\\test-06.jpg)<br>

### Populating Questions (4.6.4)

When questions are populated, they are populated as present in `uniqueQuestions` array shown above. The very first element present in this array at `index[0]` is `q-4` which is going to be populated in the first accordion where this question is represented as `q-1`. According to the figure above the second and third accordion would have `q-2 and q-9` contents present in coming accordion being represented as `Question-2 and Question-3` labels.

| Accordion Questions order | UniqueQuestions Array order |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Question-1                | q-4                         |
| Question-2                | q-2                         |
| Question-3                | q-9                         |


The above concern comes when we have to find the correct answer as previously when in practice page, questions were not shuffled and order was same so by comparing the first accordion to the first key in an array and comparing the answer have no issues. Similarly in test page 20 questions are presented, these questions contains two different sets of questions answer represented by the same `key:value` pair. To address this issue two global variables were declared and used `questionsMap, questionIdMapping`. The array `questionsMap` holds the set of array represented by the same `id:value`. This map is searched when finding the correct answer by first getting the original question id from the `questionIdMapping`.

![test-08.jpg](images\\docs\\test-08.jpg)<br>

To populate the questions into accordion following function is used.

```js
// testScript.js
function populateQuestions(randomQuestions) {
    // Initialize an object to store the mapping between shuffled and original question IDs
    randomQuestions.forEach((question, index) => {
        const words = question.words; // Get the array of words
        const questionNumber = index + 1; // Get the question ID
        const questionId = `q-${questionNumber}`;
        const questionButton = document.getElementById(questionId);
        // Populate the text content of the button with current question ID
        // it is the header of the accordion
        console.log(questionNumber);
        questionButton.textContent = `Question-${questionNumber}`;
        // Store the mapping between shuffled and original question IDs
        questionIdMapping[questionId] = question.id;
        // Loop through each word in the words array
        // Also construct correct id value
        for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            const checkboxId = questionId + `-option${i + 1}`;
            const checkbox = document.getElementById(checkboxId);
            checkbox.nextElementSibling.textContent = words[i]; // Set the label text
            console.log(words[i] + " populated:");
        }
    });
   
}
```

The above function runs a `forEach` loop and before inserting the values makes sure it has the records of which question was pointing to which Id originally. When `questionIdMapping` is printed following map is seen.

![test-09.jpg](images\\docs\\test-09.jpg)<br>


All the questions have been populated into bootstrap accordion component for the test page. Here is how the application test page renders.

![localhost-14.jpg](images\\docs\\localhost-14.jpg)<br>

### The state of the repository (4.6.5)

- Since the basic application structure has been designed and working. A new git branch is checkout from a `dev` branch. A `dev` or development branch is where all the work goes on and once it is working properly with no issues, it is merged with the main which is not  supposed to be touched if used in deployment, running in the cloud. It all depends upon which strategy is used to deploy the application. Modern [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) application uses `CICD` ( Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment) strategy to develop and deploy Web applications.
- Any feature, issues or bug fixing branch comes out of dev branch. The state of our repository is shown below.

```git
git br
  dev
* issue/implement-session
  issue/test-button-fix
  main
```

- The above informs that there are four total branches and the head is on `issue/implement-session`. This is the branch we are working to solve the session issue.
- The other branch `issue/test-button-fix` was checked out earlier to fix buttons shown on practice page not rendering well on some hand-held device. The solution was implemented so that instead of using button element an  anchor element was used to make it more light weight. Amendments made in the code is shown in [appendix-E](#appendix-e).


## Implementing Design Part-B Step 3: Page Interaction (4.7)


When a user begins a test, the system randomly generates the first 20 questions, and the test commences upon pressing the start button. The user selects different options and submits their answers by pressing the answer button. This process continues until all questions are attempted or the allotted time expires, at which point the data is automatically submitted. Currently, no feedback indicating success or failure is provided.

To manage user authentication and securely store their scores, robust authorization measures must be implemented. Various tools and methods exist for addressing these concerns.

Central to implementing this logic is identifying the logged-in user. Once authenticated, the user's test scores can be assigned and records maintained. To facilitate user authentication and session management, the express-session library is employed.

Sessions serve as communication channels between the client and server within a specified timeframe. Given that the HTTP protocol is stateless, meaning it lacks intrinsic knowledge of client identities, sessions are vital for tracking user activities. While storing user information using cookies is possible, cookies are easily accessible, hence sessions are preferred for storing sensitive data.

  
- A new module `express-session` is installed and main application `app.js` is informed by injecting this code.

```js
//app.js
app.use(session({
  secret: 'aaadfeadfdkfjadfkwerewoiadfkjdkfjweirefj',
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie :{ maxAge : 60000 * 30 } // 30 minutes
}));
```

The above code  configures session management middleware in app.js.

- The `secret`  is a string used to sign the session ID cookie to prevent tampering. It should be a long, random string to enhance security. It works as a mask to hide login or other details.
- The `resave` variable is set to true, to forces the session to be saved back to the session store, even if the session was never modified during the request. Setting it to false prevents unnecessary session updates.
- Similarly the `saveUninitialized` is also set to be true to forces a session that is "uninitialized" to be saved to the store. An uninitialized session is a new session that has not been modified. Setting it to false prevents saving sessions that haven't been modified.
- The `cookie.maxAge` variable option sets the maximum age of the session cookie in milliseconds. In this case, it's set to 30 minutes (60000 milliseconds * 30). After 30 minutes, the session expires and user is logged out automatically.
  

### Adding Session Management Logic (4.7.1)

- When a user attempts to log in, their credentials are validated against the stored information in the database. Upon successful validation, the user's username is stored in a session variable using the code `req.session.username = username;`. This functionality is implemented in the `loginController.js` file, which manages the authentication process.
- 
  
```js
//loginController.js
try {
      const isPasswordMatch = await bcrypt.compare(req.body.password, checkUser.password);
      if (isPasswordMatch) {
        //store username in session
        const username =  req.body.username;
        req.session.username = username;
        console.log(`${username} has logged in :` );
       // res.send('Logged in successfully');
        return res.render('dashboard', { title: 'Dashboard' , username: username });
      } else {
        return res.redirect('/login?error=wrong_password');
      }
```

- With this one line of code express creates a session object internally and using the information we provided earlier about the secret key and the timing , creates a cookie and sends it to the user. The following figure shows the Home page in developer mode where no cookies is present. And no session information is saved either in login page .

![session-02.jpg](images\\docs\\session-02.jpg)<br>

The right part of the figure illustrates that upon logging in, the user is directed to the Dashboard page, and a cookie is generated by the Express server using a secret key, which is then sent back to the user. It's important to note that once the permitted time period elapses, the user is automatically logged out. This authentication process involves utilizing a bcrypt hashing mechanism for authentication and session management for authorization.

### Visual Elements on Home and Dashboard Page (4.7.2)

- It can be noticed that both home page and a dashboard page has some contents, they wre added to provide navigation between the pages. Following code snippets were added in `index.ejs and dashboard.ejs`. Bootstrap cards are used as being Responsive.

```html
// index.ejs
<main>
  <div class="container mt-5">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="card mb-3">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Practice</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Not ready for login? Do practice only</p>
            <a href="/dashboard" class="btn btn-primary">Dashboard</a>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
</main>
// dashboard.ejs
<h5 class="card-title">Practice</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Get ready for the test by practising!</p>
    <a href="/practice" class="btn btn-primary">Practice Now</a>

<h5 class="card-title">Take the Test</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Ready to test your knowledge? Take the test!</p>
    <a href="/test" class="btn btn-success">Take the Test</a>
```

### Access to Test Page (4.7.3)

Initially access to test page is kept for the logged-in user and it is handled with session management. When the user wants to access the test page, it is first checked if he is logged in or not by checking its entry into session, if not the user is sent back to the login or home page. The logic above also deals with the post request coming from the test page and delegate the job tot the `testController.js`.The following code snippet of a route shows this logic.

```js
// test.js 

/* GET Test page. */
router.get('/test', function (req, res, next) {
  console.log('In test get route')
  // Check to see if user is logged in 
  const username = req.session.username;
  if (!username) {
    console.log('username:' + username + 'does not exit ')
    res.redirect(302, 'login');
  } else {
    res.render('test', { Title: 'Test page', username: username, showLogout : true});
  }
});
/* Delegate the responsibility to the login controller*/
router.post('/test', testController.handleTestRequest);
```

- The code `res.render('test', { Title: 'Test page', username: username, showLogout : true});` does number of jobs, using `res` parameter it renders the `test.ejs` page by providing values of three variables. These are `Title, username, and showLogout`. They are handled in different places. The `Title` variable is used in `head.ejs` template where it sets the title of the pge being rendered. The other two are used in other templates, lets first examine the `test.ejs` template.

  
```html
// test.ejs 
<%- include('layout/head.ejs'); %>
<%- include('layout/practiceheader.ejs', {iconClass: 'bi bi-unlock' , headerTitle: 'Take the test' }) %>
<body>
```

- When the test page is rendered, it first come across two `ejs` partials from layout folder as shown above. The second partial `practiceheader.ejs` receive the `showLogout` value in the header to decide if the logout label is to be shown or not as shown below.

```html
//practiceheader.ejs
<div class="container">
 <span class="header-text"><i class="<%= iconClass %>"></i><%= headerTitle %></span>
 <% if (showLogout) { %>
 <a href="/logout" class="anchor logout">
 <i class="bi bi-door-closed"></i>Logout</a>
 <% } %>
</div>
```

The last but not least, the variable `username` value, it is passed to  `test.ejs`, when the page is rendered. It is used by the test page in two places, first to show the message by welcoming the user, and second in the end to pass to the script which needs it.

```html
// test.ejs
  <!-- Timer display -->
<div class="mb-4">
   <p>Welcome <%= username %>, Generate questions first, then take a test! Time remaining: <span id="timer-1" class="clock">00:00</span> seconds</p>
</div>


<!-- Link to JavaScript file -->
 <script src="../bootstrap-5.0.2/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="../javascripts/topicScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="../javascripts/testScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="../javascripts/recordtestScript.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script>
  const username = "<%= username %>"; // Retrieve username from EJS template
  recordtestScript.initialise(username); // Pass username to client-side script
 </script>
</body>
</html>
```

- The reason to pass the `username` from this template is to be absolutely sure that the value is coming from the server and then it is passed to the `recordtestScript.js` where it is used in submitting the test to the server. These measures are taken so that server knows that an authorised person is taking the test.

- To securely log the user out from the website, an icon and label is added in the header bar. Its route is created in the folder. Following shows the contents of `logout.js` created in `route`folder. It simply destroys the session variable created during login.

```js 
//loguout.js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
/* GET logout page. */

/
router.get('/logout', function (req, res, next) {
    //Destroy the session 
    req.session.destroy((err) => {
        if(err) {
            console.error('Error destroying session: ', err);
        }else {
            res.redirect('/login');  
        }
    })
});
module.exports = router;
```

- Having implemented with the session management this repository is merged with the `dev` branch, this is shown below. Others files were also touched and errors were corrected. A clickable sound was added too to produce look and feel when a user clicks the answer button without giving any indication of being right or wrong.
  
![git-session-01.jpg](images\\docs\\git-session-01.jpg)

> Since the application is intended to be used by students at free of cost. A guest option is also introduce, so if one does not want to register or login, is able to take the test but wont be able to submit the test. Though the application is either way free to be used but it is just by design that the user is encouraged to register and can keep track of its progress.


### Taking a Test (4.7.4)

The `testScript.js` was used to populate the contents of the JSON into place holders using `EJS` templating engine. The logic to shuffle array in different ways and selecting unique questions was also done there. To start the test and record the activities of a user taking a test and then securely submitting is done using a new script created in a new file called `recordtestScript.js`, as usuall it is kept under `public/javascripts` folder.

Following shows the activity that happens during the test taking session.

```txt
Start: The user navigates to the test page (test.ejs).
  Page loaded it initialises StudentName Variable:
    The StudentName variable is set to the username passed by the page.
  User Clicks the Start Button:
    The handleStartTestButtonClick() function is invoked.
      Inside handleStartTestButtonClick():
        Flag Creation:
        A flag (startTestButtonClicked) created to prevent
        multiple clicks during the test. It is set to true.
      Enable  Buttons:
        All Answer Buttons within accordions are enabled.
        Submit button is also enabled
        Didable dropdownLIst during the test
      Copy Arguments to Global Variables:
        Arguments passed are copied to use within this script.
      Check User Type:
        Determine if the user taking the test is a guest.
          If it’s a guest, disable the submitTestButton.
      Show Instruction Modal:
        Display a small Bootstrap modal dialogue box with instructions.
  Start the test.
End: The test begins.
```

The above activities are shown below from the `recordtestScript.js` file.

```js
// recordtestScript.js

// Global variables needed --------------------------
let topics = {}; // reference to json object passed
let lessonName; // To hold lesson name
let correctAnswer = []; // hold original answers
let selectedLabels = []; // user selected labels
let answer = {}; // to hold user's answer
// Keep track of answered questions
const answeredQuestions = new Set(); 
let timerInterval; // Reference to timer
let studentName; // need so correct user db updated
let  points = []; // store 1 or 0
let totalScore = 0; // test score
let startTestButtonClicked = false;
//-----------------------------------------------------
// To initialise from the test file
const recordtestScript = {
    initialise: function (username) {
        studentName = username;
    }
}
//------------------------------------------------------------
// handle click event of the "Start Test" button
function handleStartTestButtonClick(topic, title) {
// check to see if it has not been pressed before !
   
if (!startTestButtonClicked) {
      startTestButtonClicked = true;
// First enable all answer button in accordion 
  enableAnswerButton();
  enableSubmitButton();
  disableDropdownList();
  topics = topic;
  lessonName = title;
// If a guest, disable the submit button.
if( studentName === 'guest') {
    const submitTestButton = document.getElementById('submit-test-btn');
    if (!submitTestButton.disabled) {
        submitTestButton.disabled = true;
    }
}
console.log('Starting test...');
const testMessage;
testMessage = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('instructions'));
testMessage.show();
startTimer(5); // Start the timer
}
console.log('Test in progress!');
}
```

- When user starts to take a test, both buttons to generate questions and starting a test button are made non functional. The clock is started ticking. The function startTimer(5) starts the timer for five minutes, its code is shown below.

```js
// recordtestScript.js
// Function to start the timer with a specified duration
function startTimer(durationInMinutes) {
 let totalSeconds = durationInMinutes * 60;
 // Update the display every second
 timerInterval = setInterval(function() {
   // Calculate minutes and seconds
   let minutes = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 60);
   let seconds = totalSeconds % 60;
   // Format the time
   const formattedTime = `${minutes.toString()
    .padStart(2, '0')}:${seconds.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
   // Get all elements with the timer class
   const timerElements = document.querySelectorAll('.clock');
   // Update the content of each timer element
   timerElements.forEach(function(timerElement) {
       timerElement.innerText = formattedTime;
   });
   // Stop the timer if time runs out
   if (totalSeconds <= 0) {
       clearInterval(timerInterval);
       console.log('Time iss up!');
       handleSubmitTestButtonClick()
   }
   // Decrement totalSeconds
   totalSeconds--;
  }, 1000); // Update every second
}
```

- To display the timing or the timer on the test page, two place holders were assigned the CSS class named `.clock` in `test.ejs`. One on the top and one at the bottom. This class is selected and its element `innerText ` property is updated to show the clock.
- This script `recordtestScript.js` has many other helper functions for example when accordion is collapsed and expanded some cleaning is done. The user is restricted to take only two options etc.
- When user selects the two options out of  five given and press `Answer` button, call comes to the following function.

```js
//recordtestScript.js 
// Function to handle the click event of the "Answer" button
function checkAnswer(questionId) {
   // A small click is needed
    playClickSound(); 
    // get user selected labels
    getSelectedLabels();
    // Only deals question if it hasn't been clicked before.
    if(!answeredQuestions.has(questionId)) {
        //first add it to set
        answeredQuestions.add(questionId);
    // helper function passing user selected with the question id
    const isCorrect = checkWithSelectedLabels(selectedLabels, questionId);
    // Push 1 being correct else 0 and increment the score or leave
    isCorrect ? (points.push(1), totalScore++) : (points.push(0), totalScore);
    } else {
    /* do not do anything it has already been handled,
     In digital test it is not allowed
     as it needs to improve attention to detail.*/
    }
}
```

- The above functions main job is to gather user choice and then call another function by passing the selectedLabels information with `questionId` parameters. It is this function which does the checking and returns the answer in a boolean format.
- The next line increases the `totalScore` variables using `++` short form to increase the counter and also pushes `1` or `0` into an array named `points`.
- When test is taken and submit button is pressed the call comes to `handleSubmitTestButtonClick()` which is shown below.

```js
//recordtestScript.js 
function handleSubmitTestButtonClick() {
    // Stop the timer by clearing the interval
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    console.log('Submitting the test...');
    // Disable the submit button to prevent multiple clicks
    const submitTestButton = document.getElementById('submit-test-btn');
    submitTestButton.disabled = true;
    // Gather result values to submit
    const results = construcTestData();
    submitTestToServer(results); // Wait for the result before proceeding   
    console.log('Test submitted successfully by ' + studentName);
    startTestButtonClicked = false;
    enableDropdownList();
    window.location.href="/logout"; 
}
```

This function, `clearInterval(timerInterval)`, is a JavaScript built-in function that stops the ticking of an interval or clock referenced by the variable `timerInterval`. It's typically used alongside the `setInterval()` function. After the timer is stopped, the submit button is disabled, and a helper function called `constructTestData()` gathers data including `totalScore` and `points`, along with `timestamps`. This data is stored in a local variable called` results`, which is then passed to the `submitTestToServer(results)` function for submission. Upon returning, flat is reset, drop down list is enabled and the user is redirected to `logout` page. `The submitTestToServer()` is shown below along with the helper function.

```js
//recordtestScript.js
// helper function
function construcTestData() {
    const timeStamp = new Date();
    const answers = [{ lessonName, timeStamp, totalScore, points }];
    return answers;
}
// Submit result with POST method
async function submitTestToServer(answers) {
 //  send the POST request
 const url = '/test';
 //  options to set , needs application/json
 const options = {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
     },
     // Convert the number to a JSON string
     body: JSON.stringify({ studentName, answers })
 };
 try {
     const response = await fetch(url, options);
     if (!response.ok) {
         throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
     }
     const data = await response.json();
     console.log('Test submitted successfully:', data);
 } catch (error) {
     console.error('Error submitting test:', error);
     throw error; 
 }
}
```

The above `submitTestToServer(answers)` function handles submitting test results to the server using a POST request.
First, it sets the URL to /test.
Second, sets the request headers to specify Content-Type as `application/json` which is must.
Third, converts the `answers` object (including studentName) to a JSON string.
And then makes the POST request using `fetch` JavaScript builtin  method.
If the response is not OK (status code other than 200), an error is thrown.
If successful, it logs the response data.
If there’s an error during the process, it logs the error and propagates it for better error handling.

> Note: In above functions a simple Bootstrap modal was used. For this to appear, a partial template `modal.ejs` is created under `views/layout` directory and referenced in `test.ejs`.

### Handling Test Submission POST Request (4.7.5)

- To handle the POST request from the test page, `testController.js` is created under `controllers` folder. The `test.js` route delegate POST request to this file. The contents are shown below.

```js
var express = require('express');
var collection = require('../modal/user');
var router = express.Router();

const handleTestRequest = async (req, res) => {
try {
const username = req.session.username;FF
console.log(`from session username is ${username}`);
const { studentName } = req.body; 
console.log(`From test page: username is ${studentName}`);
if (studentName === username) {
  console.log('Same person is taking a test:', username);
  const answers = req.body.answers; 
  // Extract 'results' array from 'answers'
  const results = answers.map(answer => ({
    lessonName: answer.lessonName,
    timeStamp: answer.timeStamp,
    totalScore: answer.totalScore,
    points: answer.points
  }));
  const updatedUser = await collection.findOneAndUpdate(
    { name: username }, 
    { $push: { results: { $each: results } } }, 
    { new: true } 
  );
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Test result saved successfully' });
} else {
  res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized: Student name does not match' });
}
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error saving test result:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
};

module.exports = {
  handleTestRequest
};
```

- The above first  defines an Express route handler `handleTestRequest()` for processing test-related requests. It  then gather the username from the session variable and from the `req.body` and compares both of them. If both matches it allows the changes to be made into the database.

- The data is then  extracted into a local variable `answers` from the request body and constructs a `results` array by mapping every variable one by one so that no information is lost.

- Once an array is constructed, mongodb `findOneAndUpdate()` function is called upon `collection` variable. This is a reference achieved at the top,  to get to the database collection. this functions find the user's name with `username` variable and if succeeds pushes an array `result` into the database collection. This process updates the database. Then handling of error is done with messages. Two layers of errors are implemented, first one ensures that the data is pushed safely and second deals with Network errors. If the names don’t match, it returns an unauthorized error.
Any errors during the process are caught and handled with appropriate status codes.

#### Updating Modal Schema (4.7.5.1)

- For the above logic to work, the modal schema is to be amended so it accommodates the changes. A new snippet is added into `modal/user.js` schema as shown below.

```js 
// user.js 
var loginSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
........ previous enteries
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    results : [{
        lessonName : { type: String, required: true},
        timeStamp: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
        totalScore : { type: Number, required: true },
        points: [Number] 
    }]

}, { timestamps: true });
```

- When a user logs in and take a test, it gets stored in the database. Following figure shows user name `Marry` document where a new field `results` is shown to have been added.

![data-added-02.jpg](images\\docs\\data-added-02.jpg)<br>

- Another figure below shows the entries of tests which have been taken.

![data-added-03.jpg](images\\docs\\data-added-03.jpg)<br>

- The figure above tells us that a user have taken number of tests of different topics. The last two being of lesson name `Opposites` and `Similar-to`.
- All four results fields can be seen starting from lesson's name to the points. Point is an arry of points achieved by the user in individual questions. The first entery tells us that the user has only attempted four questins and scored one in lesson name `Opposites` while taking a test in lesson `Similar-to`, only seven questions were attempted and scored `5`.

> Note: The above issue arises because in developement session were stored in computer memory, which is not recommended. It is advised to store the sessin variables into an onlone database store.

 Since this application is already using mongodb, the session variables to be used will also be saved there. To resolve the issue follwing steps are taken:

- A new branch `issue/online-session` is checked out 
- Installing `connect-mongodb-session` node module
- A new file `session.js` is created under `dbconfig` folder to store the sessin variables. The code is shown below.
  
```js
// session.js
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoDBStore = require('connect-mongodb-session')(session);
const connectMongoDB = require('../dbconfig/connection');

function sessionMiddleware() {
    const store = new MongoDBStore({
        uri: process.env.MONGODB_URI,
        collection: 'sessions',
    });
    const mongoSession = session({
        secret: 'aaadfeadfdkfjadfkwerewoiadfkjdkfjweirefj',
        resave: false,
        saveUninitialized: true,
        store: store,
        cookie: { maxAge: 60000 * 60 }
    });
    return mongoSession;
}
module.exports = sessionMiddleware;

```

- The code starts first to require a reference on `connect-mongodb-session` module by having an `exress-session` module referenced inside it as `(connect-mongodb-session)(session)`.
- Using this reference `MongoDBStore` a new instance is created setting its uri to be the one this application is using and saved in env file. It also tells the the store to use the collection name `sessions` in the database to store the variables.
- Then `session` variables are set. Both variables `store & mongoSession` are wrapped in a function named `sessionMiddleware` which is then exported to be used somewhere else.
- This variable is used in `app.js` as shown below.

```js 
//app.js 
connectMongoDb();
app.use(sessionMiddleware());
```

> The first line connects the application to onlone mongodb server as discussed earlier and the second line `app` instance is asked to use `sessionMiddleware`, it only works if `()` is used as it is a function and it has to be invoked to be used.

- Once the job is done and checked to be working with online dbstore, the repository was merged to development branch as shown below.

### Generating Mock Test Data into Online MongoDb Database 

- In section (4.4.7) above it was shown that the application successfully saves data into an online store. At that stage no realtime interactions was present between pages. Only new users were registered, the app has the capability to not only store the users but the test data belonging to the uer.
- In order to test the creation of the result automatically, few functions were created and tested, they are shown below. 
- Three new functions were created 

```js 
// Creatin of smaple data was done by using these methods
async function handleSubmitTestButtonClick() {
    // Stop the timer by clearing the interval
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    // Gather result values to submit
    const results = construcTestData();
    console.log(results);
    for (let loopCount = 1; loopCount <= 20; loopCount++) {
        const results = construcTestData();
        try {
            await submitTestToServer(results); // Wait for the result before proceeding
            console.log(`Test ${loopCount} submitted successfully`);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error submitting test ${loopCount}:`, error);
        }
    }
}
// To count the result within an array
function count(points) {
    let onesCount = 0;
    for (const point of points) {
        if (point === 1) {
            onesCount++;
        }
    }
    return onesCount;
}
// construcing data
function construcTestData() {
    points = generateRandomArrayAgrade(20);
    totalScore = count(points);
    const timeStamp = getRandomDateWithinLast10Days();
    console.log(timeStamp);
    const answers = [{ lessonName, timeStamp, totalScore, points }];
    return answers;
}
// generating random date to be used
function getRandomDateWithinLast10Days() {
    const currentDate = new Date();
    const tenDaysAgo = new Date(currentDate);
    const randomDecimal = Math.random();
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(randomDecimal * 8) + 1;
    tenDaysAgo.setDate(tenDaysAgo.getDate() - randomNumber);
    // Generate a random hour between 8 and 22 (10 p.m.)
    const randomHour = Math.floor(Math.random() * 15) + 8;
    // Create a new date with the random hour
    const randomDate = new Date(tenDaysAgo);
    randomDate.setHours(randomHour, 0, 0, 0);
    return randomDate;
}
// Random array of scores
function generateRandomArrayAgrade(length) {
    const randomArray = Array.from({ length }, () => 0); // Initialize with zeros
    // Generate a random number of 1s between 13 and 20 (inclusive)
    const numOnes = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) + 13;
    // Set the values at random indices to 1
    for (let i = 0; i < numOnes; i++) {
      let randomIndex;
      do {
        randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * length);
      } while (randomArray[randomIndex] === 1); // Ensure we don't overwrite existing 1s
      randomArray[randomIndex] = 1;
    }
    return randomArray;
  }
```


- Once a user is logged in, enters the test page and generate random questions, then test is started, instead of taking a test submit button is pressed, the call goes to `handleSubmitTestButtonClick` function where a loop is run 20 times, each time data is constructed with `construcTestData()`.
- While constructing the data it calls `generateRandomArrayAgrade` function which returns an array of `[1,0,0,1,0,1,0]`, then this array is passed to anoter function `count` to the `totalScore`.
- Similarly a new date is created in last ten days randomly and stored in a variable called `timeStamp`. All these variables are wrapped in an object and placed in an array , as mongodb deals better with objets that are present in array well.
- Then this data is referenced in `answers` variable and `submitTestToServer` function is called.
- The generation of data was recoreded on the console and online, it successfully enters the data without having any problems.
- It was repeated with three new real accounts with mock email addresses confirming the format.
- Once enogh data was poupulated, a profile report is created.

### Creatign a profile page 

A new file `profile.ejs` is created in `views` folder, to access a profile page, new bootstap header usign `nav-bar` is created into an new partial name `dash-nav.ejs` which was added to `dashboard.ejs` page. When it renders it shows three bar on the right hand corner when screen is not wide to accomodate hand-held devices as shwon below on left hand while on the right it is shwon with wide screen.

![nav-bar-01.jpg](images\\docs\\nav-bar-01.jpg)

- When `profile` button is pressed, the call goes to the `profile` route to render the page. To handle this request a new route is created in route directory, the contents are shown below.

```js 
// profile.js 
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const User = require('../modal/user');

// Profile page route
router.get('/profile', async (req, res) => {
    const username = req.session.username;
    //const source = req.query.source;
if (username) {
  try {
    // Fetch the user's data from MongoDB
    const user = await User.findOne({name:username});
    if (!user) {
        return res.status(404).send('User not found');
    }
    // Extract required data from the results array
    const profileData = user.results.map(result => ({
        timeStamp: result.timeStamp,
        lessonName: result.lessonName,
        totalScore: result.totalScore
    }));
    console.log(profileData);
   res.render('profile', { title: 'Profile',
   username: username, showLogout: true, profileData: profileData });
  }catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching profile data:', error);
      res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
} else {
          console.log('User does not exist');
          res.redirect(302, 'login');
} 
});
module.exports = router;  
```

- This route checks the user entery into a session variable `req.session.username`. This `session` object was earlier created with `connect-mongodb-session` with the help of `express-session` module. This preness also creates a `sessions` collections inot online mongodb store and store the loged in user detail.
- So the first line checks this variable presence in mongodb database if it is present then it means that the user has already logged in and is allowed to do the operations. 
- Once it is chcked with sessin variable, it is agains checked by the name which is present in the session variable against the original user database using `findOne` method. If it fails a `404` message is sent otherwise the data is read from the online store for this user.
- A map object is used to map the stored data into a variable called `profileData`. this variable is then passed with request sent to render the `/profile` page. Theer are other variables passed, they are examined below.

| Variables Passed | Usage                                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| title            | Sets the page title in browser title bar             |
| username         | To be used in ejs template if needs be               |
| showLogout       | To decide, if the logout icon to be shown or not     |
| profileData      | Acutal read data from the online database to be used |

> Note: when the user is not logged in the profile page has nothing to show to the user, so it is redirected to login page.

- To allow every one to use the application guest option is kept and allowed from the home page. When user enters into the website as a guest, the application stores a variable name `guest` into the sessions in database. Every online session lasts for an hour as set by store when creating, and it is logged out automatically.
- To show the difference between the logged in user and a guest, differents icons are used. The following logic present in ejs template decides if guest is logged in and if it is different icons is used when rendering the page. It is shwon below.


```ejs
// present in partials
// dash-nav.ejs, practiceheader.ejs
<% if (showLogout && username==='guest' ) { %>
      <a href="/logout" class="anchor logout">
        <i class="bi bi-android"></i> Logout
      </a>
      <% } else { %>
        <a href="/logout" class="anchor logout">
          <i class="bi bi-door-closed-fill"></i> Logout
        </a>
        <% } %>
```

- The above logic present in template uses two variables passed to them by the server route in this template and decides if the `guest` is present and if it is renders an icon with `class='bi bi-android'`.
- Though guest is alloed to use the practice and take a test but not allowed to submit the data to online database.
- If the user has logged in and wants to see his test result or all the results previously taken, he is shown a card with the latest result achievement. Here is a snap shot taken from the mobile android device where this app was running. The left side snapshot shows only the top most record in a bootstrap card class, while the right snapshot shows the list of all the test taken of only one lesson that is `opposite`.

> Note: To see the result of all the test, the user needs to press the button lablelled `Full Report`. This button toggles to show and hide the results. When it is visible the scorll bar moves and inidtates that it is present and needs scrolling. Upon second touch it is hidden.

![profile-03.jpg](images\\docs\profile-03.jpg)

- Following shows small snippet from the `profile.ejs` template where the data sent by the server using `/profile` route is used to render the data in the page using bootstrap card component.
  
```html 
<div class="flex-grow-1">
 <h5 class="mb-1">Username: <%= username %></h5>
 <p class="mb-2 pb-1" style="color: #2b2a2a;">Student</p>
 <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center rounded-3 p-2 mb-2" style="background-color: #efefef;">
 <% if (profileData && profileData.length > 0) { %>
  <!-- Display the first test result -->
  <div class="px-0">
      <p class="small text-muted mb-2">Test Date</p>
      <p class="mb-0 pt-2"><%= profileData[0].timeStamp.toDateString() %></p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-3">
      <p class="small text-muted mb-2">Lesson Name</p>
      <p class="mb-1 pt-2"><%= profileData[0].lessonName %></p>
  </div>
  <div class="px-3">
      <p class="small text-muted mb-2">Total Score</p>
      <p class="mb-0  pt-2">
<%= profileData[0].totalScore %></p><%= Math.round(profileData[0].totalScore / 20 * 100) %>%
  </div>
 <% } else { %>
     <p>No test results available.</p>
 <% } %>
 </div>
 <div class="d-grid gap-2 d-md-flex justify-content-md-start">
     <button id="showAll" type="button"
     class="btn btn-outline-primary me-md-2 mb-2 mb-md-0">Full Report</button>
     <a href="/dashboard" class="btn btn-link">Dashboard</a>
```

- To show and hide the test report, script is used in steyle, that is used inside the template, shown below.
  
```js 
//profile.ejs
<script>
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
  const showAllButton = document.getElementById('showAll');
  const allResultSection = document.getElementById('allResult');
  showAllButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
    if (allResultSection.style.display === 'none') {
      allResultSection.style.display = 'block';
    } else {
      allResultSection.style.display = 'none';
    }
  });
});
</script>
```

- The place holder for the full report is shown below, it is this portion which is controlled by the script and toggels.

```html
//profile.ejs

<div id="allResult">
<div class="container mt-5">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-header">
      <h5 class="card-title">Test Results</h5>
    </div>
<div class="card-body">
  <% if (profileData.length> 0) { %>
<% profileData.forEach(result=> { %>
  <div class="mb-3">
    <p>Date: <%= result.timeStamp.toDateString() %>
    </p>
    <p>Lesson: <%= result.lessonName %>
    </p>
    <p>Total Score: <%= result.totalScore %>
     / 20 (Percentage: <%= Math.round(result.totalScore / 20 *
          100) %>%)</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <% }); %>
    <% } else { %>
      <p>No test results available.</p>
      <% } %>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
      </div>
```

## Turning Web Application into PWA

To make a web application a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), following steps are taken.

1. Registering the Service Worker: This step enables the PWA to work offline and handle background tasks, provided cacheing stratages are correctly implmented.
2. Creating the Service Worker File: A file named `sw.js` is created. This service worker file will be responsible for intercepting network requests, caching assets, and managing offline functionality.
3. Defining Service Worker Logic: It is defined in `sw.js` file by specifing how the service worker should handle different events, such as fetching resources, caching data, and updating the cache.
4. Creating a Manifest File: This JSON file provides metadata about the PWA, including its name, icons, start URL, and display mode. The manifest helps the service worker understand the assets and behavior of the application.
5. Informing the Header of the Home Page: Instructing the header of home page to reference the `manifest.json` file. This ensures that the browser recognizes the app as a PWA and displays the install prompt when appropriate.


### Logic to attach the Application with the Service Worker


A new file `register-service-worker.js` is created under the `public/javascripts` directory. The contents are shown below.

```js
// register-service-worker.js

if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    window.addEventListener('load', () => {
        navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js')
            .then(reg => {
                console.log('Service worker registered:', reg);
            })
            .catch(err => {
                console.error('Service worker registration failed:', err);
            });
    });
}
```

The above code register the running application using an arrow [`=>`](#appendix-c) function expression with a service worker file `sw.js`. The service workder `sw.js` is not yet present and can be noticed. When the application or express framework is started from the terminal the activities are shown there, the application  now tries to find this file  `sw.js` file in the root of the website since it is not present, express frame work rightly displays the `404` message as shown in the following figure.

![sw-01.jpg](images\\docs\\sw-01.jpg)<br>
*figure-30*


A new file name `sw.js` is created under `public` directory. This file sits in the middle and by sitting here, in between the server and client side it works as a broker between them and handles request going to network and decides what can be served from the cache instead of going to server.

### Service Worker vs Client/Server Architecture

So far in this  application the request and response between the client and server was happening directly. From now on this file takes the responsibility to serve the pages so that it can take help form cache mechanisms. In this file, instructions are written about what pages are to be cached, and what service to be provided and how to provide them. As it is said earlier that in order to use the cache mechanisms, the code is to be written in `sw.js` file. But recently [Google](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/))  has provided a service called `workbox-sw.js` which can be used in conjunction with the local service worker easing the burden to write all the logic.  Following graph shows this scenario.


![service-worker-01.jpg](images\\docs\\service-worker-01.jpg)


Following are the contents of `sw.js` in the beginning

```js
// sw.js

importScripts(
    'https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/6.4.1/workbox-sw.js'
  );
  // Precache manifest
const precacheManifest = [
    //  icon paths to be cached
    '/icon/icon-192x192.png',
    '/icon/icon-512x512.png',
  ]; 
  // Set up Workbox to precache assets
  // Cache icon requests
  workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ request }) => request.destination === 'image' &&
      request.url.includes('/icons/'),
    new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst()
  );
  workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ request }) => request.destination === 'image' &&
      request.url.includes('/images/'),
    new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst()
  );
  
  workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ request }) => request.destination === 'script' || request.destination === 'style',
    new workbox.strategies.StaleWhileRevalidate()
  );
  
  workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ request }) => request.mode === 'navigate',
    new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst()
  );

  //
  workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ url }) => url.pathname === '/',
    new workbox.strategies.CacheFirst()
);

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ url }) => url.pathname.startsWith('/login'),
    new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst()
);

workbox.routing.registerRoute(
    ({ url }) => url.pathname.startsWith('/signup'),
    new workbox.strategies.NetworkFirst()
);

```

The tasks accomplished above after importing Workbox from workbox-dcn can be outlined as follows:

1. Initially, an array of precaching assets is created, defining which icons should be cached. Then, the Workbox service is configured to utilize this array.
2. All the routes utilized in the application are specified to Workbox individually, ensuring that the service is aware of them.
3. Specific caching mechanisms are set for Workbox to employ. The available options include CacheFirst(), NetworkFirst(), and StaleWhileRevalidate(), each fulfilling its function as described by its name. Upon injecting the service worker, the Express framework's notification changes from 404 to 200, indicating that the file is successfully located in the application's root.

Although the service worker contains details of the assets to be cached, this information alone is insufficient. The service worker also needs to know the local folder paths of these assets, along with other necessary details for the PWA. All this information is consolidated in a file named manifest.json.


### Creating and attaching manifest file

A `manifest.json` file is added at the root of the client site which is `public` directory to inform the application that a `manifest.json` file is to be used in this  application. This is known as `attaching manifest to PWA`. To do so its entry is made in the head section of the home page .The following snippets shows its contents.

```html
// layout/head.ejs 

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title><%= title %></title>
  </title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico">
  <!-- Link to manifest.json -->
  <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">
  <!-- Link to local Bootstrap CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/bootstrap-5.0.2/css/bootstrap.min.css">
  <!-- Link to Custom CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/styles.css">
  <!-- bootstrap icons cdn link -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/font/bootstrap-icons.min.css">
</head>
```
  
The  contents fo `manifest.json` are  shown below. They are not all and more options will be added as the application progresses.

```json

    "name": "Verbal Reasoning for 11+",
    "short_name": "11+",

Beginning with manifest.json, the application extracts vital details such as the long and short names, as well as various icon specifications required for both large and small handheld devices. Additionally, it includes information regarding the application's entry point and suitable background and foreground colors. The service worker `sw.js` interprets these instructions, enabling the application to operate with cache functionality and function offline. Furthermore, it facilitates the installation of the PWA. To ensure the application meets PWA criteria, SEO (search engine optimization) information is incorporated into the head section of the homepage, alongside other relevant details.

  <meta name="description" content="11+ app for verbal reasoning to help students prepare for this exam">
```

> Note: The contents of the `sw.js` and `manifest.json` are much longer than the code snippets shown above. They can be seen in online repository.

### Browser behaviour after registering the Service Worker

- When application is started in a browser using developer mode, number of things can be observed. Following shows the message along with `workbox` service responding to different requests.

The activity depands upon how `sw.js` is instructed to bheave.

### Fulfilling Google's PWA Criteria

Once the application is prepared, testing becomes crucial, particularly using `Lighthouse` utility in `incognito mode` to ensure optimal performance. Lighthouse conducts a series of tests for both mobile and desktop devices.

#### Initial Desktop Device Testing

1. The testing commences with the `Home Page`, denoted by `index.ejs`, which loads upon user visitation. Here, various categories are selected for testing.

![light-house-desktop-01.jpg](images\\docs\\light-house-desktop-01.jpg)

2. Upon initiating the analysis of page load, Lighthouse begins loading pages and scrutinizing their contents for the selected categories. The following result is displayed.

![light-house-desktop-02.jpg](images\\docs\\light-house-desktop-02.jpg)

3. In the `accessibility` category, the test fails due to incongruent background and foreground colors for the `Dashboard` link. This discrepancy arises from the use of the `text-success` class as an inline CSS property within the page (`<a href="/guest/login" class="text-success">Dashboard</a></p>`). To rectify this, the class is modified to `test-dark`, resulting in a successful retest.

![light-house-desktop-03.jpg](images\\docs\\light-house-desktop-03.jpg)

Upon implementing this minor adjustment, the application now passes all categories, qualifying it as a candidate for PWA on desktop platforms. During this testing phase, Lighthouse utility triggers frequent server calls for various purposes. These calls are recorded in the terminal while running Express in developer mode and are crucial for retrieving assets, icons, and styles needed for page rendering.

- The above calls made by the clinets are served by Node.js server and all calls have status (200) that is o.k except which is shown by the line above. This fails becuase our application does not have the `robots.txt` present in the root directory, this file is searched by the google agents when serarching is doone for some contents. It will be provided later on.
  
> Note: The above test was for only home page, our application has total four main pages apart from Login and Register. Among these four, the two of them have UI contents and they are heavily populated. So the next test is done for the test page as it has twenty individual accordions grouped toghter to make and look as if they are part of one item.


![light-house-desktop-04.jpg](images\\docs\\light-house-desktop-04.jpg)

The above reporsts informs us ( not fully shown in the figure ) that the application needs to compact the all javascripts and styles and then compresse as well to get the 100%. Since it is not an issue it will be done later on as well.

Now the same tests are repeated for mobile application the reslt is hown below.

![light-house-desktop-05.jpg](images\\docs\\light-house-desktop-05.jpg)

To improve the performance, follwing suggestions are given they are all related to compression and minfication of the assessets which will be done at later stage.

![light-house-desktop-06.jpg](images\\docs\\light-house-desktop-06.jpg)

The process of nimificatin and compression requrires other utility packages to be installed and build scripts are written to get the job done. As this is a continuous process of making the applicatin perfomance better, many jobs will be done in due course.

### Testing of application as PWA on devices

- All new chnaged were pushed to GitHub and consequently fetched by the Render platrom and automatic deploment happens in the back ground. No issues were found with the following exception. 
- This application is now installable on both wide screen and mobile devices, it behaves well. The only exception faced was to use it without the internet facility. The idea is that all the contents are to be downloaded and shuld work in offline mode using cache mechanisim.
- It is not a very big job but our application has to stick to certain rules, it can either apply all the contents without having to ask any logging or regestration from the user or if user is obliged to login and regeister, then guest can not be allowed as both do not go together and at the same time all the contents are to work offline. The reason being that the application uses an online Mongodb store to save user informatin and data. Even session are saved in online database. When user previous reports are to be accessed or new test results are to be entered offline mode can not work.
- Thus it was decided to keep providing the guest access to practice and take the test but contorlling them to being not able to interact with online facilities. This is the reason that this application will not work in offline mode fully yet it can still work if one has installed and used it and does not clear its cache and do not attemp to login.

#### Conclusion about PWA 

- The application works as PWA and passes Goggle's PWA criteria it can be imporved by desinging the correct strategy and place in swervice worker `sw.js` file.

- Besides being PWA, numerous tests were done using Chrome provided tools to see any potential memory leak or any stack over flow but none was found.



## Testing Deployed Application 

- The site whre the [application](https://h446alevel.onrender.com/) is deployed was open in one borwser, a new user was logged in with the following credentials. 

```txt
Name: Jill Williams
Email: jill@mail.com
Password: jill1234..
```

- The acccount was registered successfully. Along with brownser, Render site was also open showing its terminal. Activites were monitered side by side, the app performed well and when the new user Jill took the test it successfully submitted the test result.
- The data creation in user account in the from of an array was inserted with the result recieved with `POST/test 200`.
- Fowlling activity is shown from online render account.

```txt

```

- The above logs does not show the terminal timaing but this snapshot does.

![render-05.jpg](images\\docs\\render-05.jpg)

The figure shows that Jiss post request was logged on `May 2 9:36 ` when we check the mongodb online account we find the following as shown in the figure below.

![mongodb-online-01.jpg](images\\docs\\mongodb-online-01.jpg);

1. Jill Williams account was created on `May, 2 at 19:51` and then updated at `May, 2 at 20:36`. This `20:36` is the same time shown on Render terminal but with one hour difference, probably due to British Summer time not updated in different regions in the world.

2. It also shows that an new test entery was made on the same date at `20:36` where Jill has only attempted three questions and scored `2`. 

3. With the above activity it is shown that not only the applicatin is working but performing well with the user interaction.

### Appendix-C

1. **Arrow function expression**: is a short form of conventional function expression used in javascript.

  ```js

  ```
2. **Asynchronous function**: It is a part of `promised` based APIs, it works in conjunction with `await` returning a new promise. As the name suggest this function is designed to be used in places where a thread is not to be blocked because some job has not been finished, so the code inside the function can wait.
